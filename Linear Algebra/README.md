# Linear Algebra

Based on the course [MATH133](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2022-2023/courses/math-133) from McGill University. This is the most basic, entry-level linear algebra course.

This course roughly follows *Linear Algebra with Applications* by W. Keith Nicholson. The textbook can be found [here](https://egunawan.github.io/la22sp/textbook/Nicholson2021A.pdf).
