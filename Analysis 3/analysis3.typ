== A Review of Riemann Integration

Let $f : RR-> RR$ and $[a,b] subset RR$. Define a *partition* of $[a,b]$ as the set $
"part"([a,b]) := {a =: x_0 < x_1 < dots.c < x_N := b}.
$
We can then define the upper and lower Riemann integrals of $f$ over the region $[a,b]$ as $
"upper:" #h(2em) overline(integral_a^b) f(x) dif x := inf_("part"([a,b])) {sum_(i=1)^N sup_(x in [x_(i-1), x_(i)]) f(x) dot.c (x_i - x_(i-1))}\
"lower:" #h(2em) underline(integral_a^b) f(x) dif x := sup_("part"([a,b])) {sum_(i=1)^N inf_(x in [x_(i-1), x_(i)]) f(x) dot.c (x_i - x_(i-1))}.
$
We then say $f$ *Riemann integrable* if these two quantities are equal, and denote this value by $integral_a^b f(x) dif x$.

Many "nice-enough" (continuous, monotonic, etc.) functions are Riemann integrable, but many that we would like to be able to "integrate" are simply not, for instance Dirichlet's function $x |-> cases(
  1  x in QQ \\ [a, b]\
0  x in QQ^c \\ [a,b]).$ Hence, we need a more general notion of integration.

== Sigma Algebras

#definition("Sigma algebra")[
Let $X$ be a _space_ (a nonempty set) and $cal(F)$ a collection of subsets of $X$. $cal(F)$ a _sigma algebra_ or simply $sigma$-algebra of $X$ if the following hold:
+ $X in cal(F)$
+ $A in cal(F) => A^c in cal(F)$ (closed under complement)
+ ${A_n}_(n in NN) subset.eq cal(F) => union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n in cal(F)$ (closed under countable unions)
]

#proposition[
4. $nothing in cal(F)$
5. ${A_n}_(n in NN) subset.eq cal(F) => sect.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n in cal(F)$
6. $A_1, dots, A_n in cal(F) => union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n, sect.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n in cal(F)$
7. $A, B in cal(F) => A \\ B, B \\ A in cal(F)$
]

#example[
  The "largest" sigma algebra of a set $X$ is the power set $2^X$, the smallest the trivial ${nothing, X}$. 

  Given a set $A subset X$, the set $cal(F)_A := {nothing, X, A, A^c}$ is a sigma algebra; given two disjoint sets $A, B subset X$, then $cal(F)_(A, B) := {nothing, X, A, A^c, B, B^c, A union B, A^c sect B^c}$ a sigma algebra.
]

#definition("Generating a sigma algebra")[
  Let $X$ be a nonempty set, and $cal(C)$ a collection of subsets of $X$. Then, the $sigma$-algebra _generated_ by $cal(C)$, denoted $sigma(cal(C))$, is such that
  + $sigma(cal(C))$ a sigma algebra with $cal(C) subset.eq sigma(cal(C))$
  + if $cal(F)'$ a sigma algebra with $cal(C) subset.eq cal(F)'$, then $cal(F)' supset.eq sigma(cal(C))$

  Namely, $sigma(cal(C))$ is the smallest sigma algebra "containing" (as a subset) $cal(C)$.
]

#proposition[
  + $sigma(cal(C)) = sect.big {cal(F) : cal(F) " a sigma algebra containing " cal(C)}$
  + if $cal(C)$ itself a sigma algebra, then $sigma(cal(C)) = cal(C)$
  + if $cal(C)_1, cal(C)_2$ are two collections of subsets of $X$ such that $cal(C)_1 subset.eq cal(C)_2$, then $sigma(cal(C)_1) subset.eq sigma(cal(C)_2)$
]

#definition("The Borel sigma-algebra")[
The _Borel $sigma$-algebra_, denoted $frak(B)_RR$, on the real line is given by $
frak(B)_RR := sigma({"open subsets of " RR}).
$
We call sets in $frak(B)_RR$ _Borel sets_.
]

#proposition[
  $frak(B)_RR$ is also generated by the sets 
  - ${(a, b) : a < b in RR}$
  - ${(a, b] : a < b in RR}$
  - ${[a, b] : a < b in RR}$
  - ${[a, b) : a < b in RR}$ $ast.circle$
  - ${(-infinity, c) : c in RR}$
  - ${(-infinity, c] : c in RR}$
  - etc.
]

#proof[
We prove just $ast.circle$. It suffices to show that the generating sets of each $sigma$-algebra is contained in the other $sigma$-algebra. Let $a < b in RR$. Then, $
(a, b) = union.big_(n=1)^infinity underbrace([a + 1/n, b), in ast.circle) in sigma({[a, b)})  => frak(B)_RR subset.eq sigma({[a, b)}).
$
Conversely, $
[a, b) = sect.big_(n=1)^infinity (a - 1/n, b) in frak(B)_RR.
$
]

#proposition[
  All intervals (open, closed, half open, half closed, finite, etc) are Borel sets; any set obtained from countable set operations of intervals are Borel; all singletons are Borel; any finite and countable sets are Borel.
]

== Measures

#definition("Measurable Space")[
Let $X$ be a space and $cal(F)$ a $sigma$-algebra. We call the tuple $(X, cal(F))$ a _measurable space_.
]

#definition("Measure")[
Let $(X, cal(F))$ be a measurable space. A _measure_ is a function $mu : cal(F) -> [0, infinity]$ satisfying

(i) $mu(nothing) = 0$;

(ii) if ${A_n} subset.eq cal(F)$ a sequence of (pairwise) disjoint sets, then $
mu(union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n) = sum_(n=1)^infinity mu(A_n),
$
i.e. $mu$ is _countably additive_. We further call $mu$
- _finite_ if $mu(X) < infinity$,
- a _probability measure_ if $mu(X) = 1$,
- $sigma$-finite if $exists {A_n} subset.eq cal(F)$ such that $X = union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n$ with $mu(A_n) < infinity forall n >= 1$,
and call the triple $(X, cal(F), mu)$ a _measure space_.
]

#example[
  The measure on $frak(B)_RR$ given by $
  A |-> cases(|A| "if" A "finite"\ infinity " else")
  $ is called the _counting measure_. 

  Fix $x_0 in RR$, then the measure on $frak(B)_RR$ given by $
  A |-> cases(1 "if" x_0 in A\ 0 "else")
  $ is called the _point mass at $x_0$_.
]

#theorem("Properties of Measures")[
  Fix a measure space $(X, cal(F), mu)$. The following properties hold:
  + (finite additivity) For any sequence ${A_n}_(n=1)^N subset.eq cal(F)$ of disjoint sets, $
  mu(union.big_(n=1)^N A_n) = sum_(n=1)^N mu(A_n).
  $
  + (monotonicity) For any $A subset.eq B in cal(F)$, then $mu(A) <= mu(B)$.
  + (countable/finite subadditivity) For any sequence ${A_n} subset.eq cal(F)$ (*not* necessarily disjoint), $
  mu(union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n) <= sum_(n=1)^infinity mu(A_n),
  $ an analogous statement holding for a finite collection of sets $A_1, dots, A_N$.
  + (continuity from below) For ${A_n} subset.eq cal(F)$ such that $A_n subset.eq A_(n+1) forall n >= 1$ (in which case we say ${A_n}$ "increasing" and write $A_n arrow.t$) we have $
  mu(union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n) = lim_(n-> infinity) mu(A_n).
  $
  + (continuity from above) For ${A_n} subset.eq cal(F), A_n supset.eq A_(n+1) forall n >= 1$ (we write $A_n arrow.b$) we have that *if* $mu(A_1) < infinity$ ,
  $
  mu(sect.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n) = lim_(n-> infinity) mu(A_n).
  $
]

#remark[
In 4., note that since $A_n$ increasing, that the union $union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n supset.eq A_m$ for any arbitrarily large $m$; indeed, one could logically right $lim_(n-> infinity) A_n = union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n$. In this notation, then, 4. simply states that we may interchange limit and measure. A similar argument can be viewed for 5. (how?).
]

#remark[
  The finiteness condition in 5. may be slightly modified such as to state that $mu(A_n) < infinity$ for some $n$; remark why this would suffice to ensure the entire rest of the sequence has finite measure.
]

#proof[
1. Extend $A_1, dots, A_N$ to an infinite sequence by $A_n := nothing$ for $n > N$. Then this simply follows from countable additivity and $mu(nothing) = 0$.
2. We may write $B = A union (B \\ A)$; this is a disjoint union of sets. By finite additivity, then, $
mu(B) = mu(A) + mu(B \\ A) >= mu(A),
$ since the measure is positive.
3. We prove only for a countable union; use the technique from 1. to extend to finite. We first "disjointify" the sequence such that we can use the countable additivity axiom. Let $B_1 = A_1, B_n = A_n \\ (union.big_(i=1)^(n-1) A_i)$ for $n >= 2$. Remark then that ${B_n} subset.eq cal(F)$ is a disjoint sequence of sets, and that $union.big_(n=1)^infinity B_n = union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n$. By countable additivity and subadditivity, $
mu(union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n) = mu(union.big_(n=1)^infinity B_n) = sum_(n=1)^infinity mu(B_n) <= sum_(n=1)^infinity mu(A_n).
$
4. We again "disjointify" the sequence ${A_n}$. Put $B_1 = A_1$, $B_n = A_n \\ A_(n-1)$ for all $n >= 2$ (remark that this is equivalent to the construction from the previous proof because the sets are increasing). Then, again, $union.big_(n=1)^infinity B_n = union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n$, and in particular, for all $N >= 1$, $union.big_(n=1)^N B_n = A_N$. Then $
mu(union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n) = mu(union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n) &= sum_(n=1)^infinity mu(B_n)\
&= lim_(N-> infinity) sum_(n=1)^N mu(B_n)\
&= lim_(N-> infinity) mu(union.big_(n=1)^N B_n) = lim_(N->infinity) mu(A_N).
$
5. We yet again disjointify, backwards (in a way) from the previous case. Put $B_n = A_1 \\ A_n$ for all $n  >= 1$. Then, ${B_n} subset.eq cal(F)$, $B_n$ increasing, and $union.big_(n=1)^infinity B_n = A_1 \\ sect.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n$. Then, by continuity from below, $
mu(A_1 \\ sect.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n) = mu(union.big_(n=1)^infinity B_n) = lim_(n-> infinity) mu(B_n) = lim_(n-> infinity) mu(A_1 \\ A_n)
$ and also $
mu(A_1) &= mu(A_1 \\ sect.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n) + mu(sect.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n)\
&= mu(A_1 \\ A_n) + mu(A_n),
$ and combining these two equalities yields the desired result.

== Constructing the Lebesgue Measure on $RR$

#definition("Lebesgue outer measure")[
For all $A subset.eq RR$, define $
m^ast (A) := inf { sum_(n=1)^infinity ell(I_n) : A subset.eq union.big_(n=1)^infinity I_n, I_n "open intervals"},
$ called the _Lebesgue outer measure_ of $A$ (where $ell(I)$ is the length of interval $I$, i.e. the absolute value of the difference of its endpoints, if finite, or $infinity$ if not).
]

#proposition[
  The following properties of $m^ast$ hold:
  + $m^ast (A) >= 0$ for all $A subset.eq RR$, and $m^ast (nothing) = 0$.
  + (monotonicity) For $A subset.eq B$, $m^ast (A) lt.eq m^ast (B)$.
  + (countable subadditivity) For ${A_n}, A_n subset.eq RR$, $m^ast (union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n) lt.eq sum_(n=1)^infinity m^ast (A_n)$.#footnote([More generally, any set function on $2^RR$ that satisfies 1., 2., and 3. is called an _outer measure_.])
  + If $I subset.eq RR$ an interval, then $m^ast (I) = ell(I)$.
  + $m^ast$ is translation invariant; for any $A subset.eq R, x in RR$, $m^ast (A) = m^ast (A + x)$ where $A + x := {a + x : a in A}$.
  + For all $A subset.eq RR$, $m^ast (A) = inf {m^ast (B) : A subset.eq B subset.eq R, B - "open"}$.
  + If $A = A_1 union A_2 subset.eq RR$ with $d(A_1, A_2) > 0,$#footnote("Remark: this is a stronger requirement than disjointness!") then $m^ast (A_1) + m^ast (A_2) = m^ast (A)$.
  + If $A = union.big_(k=1)^infinity J_k$ where $J_k$'s are "almost disjoint intervals" (i.e. share at most endpoints), then $m^ast (A) = sum_(k=1)^infinity m^ast (J_k) = sum_(k=1)^infinity ell(J_k).$
]

#proof[
3. If $m^ast (A_n) = infinity$, for any $n$, we are done, so assume wlog $m^ast (A_n) < infinity$ for all $n$. Then, for each $n$ and $epsilon > 0$, one can choose open intervals ${I_(n,i)}_(i >= 1)$ such that $A_n subset.eq union.big_(i=1)^infinity I_(n, i)$ and $sum_(i=1)^infinity ell(I_(n,i)) lt.eq m^ast (A_n) + epsilon/(2^n)$. Hence $
union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n subset.eq union.big_(n=1, i = 1)^infinity I_(n, i)\
=> m^(ast) (union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n) lt.eq sum_(n, i = 1)^infinity ell(I_(n, i)) = sum_(n=1)^infinity sum_(i=1)^infinity ell(I_(n, i)) lt.eq sum_(n=1)^infinity (m^ast (A_n) + epsilon/(2^n)) = sum_(n=1)^infinity m^(ast) (A_n) + epsilon,
$
and as $epsilon$ arbitrary, the statement follows.

4. We prove first for $I = [a, b]$. For any $epsilon > 0$, set $I_1 = (a - epsilon, b + epsilon)$; then $I subset.eq I_1$ so $m^ast (I) lt.eq ell(I_1) = (b - 1) + 2 epsilon$ hence $m^ast (I) lt.eq b - a = ell(I)$. Conversely, let ${I_n}$ be any open-interval convering of $I$ (wlog, each of finite length; else the statement holds trivially). Since $I$ compact, it can be covered by finitely many of the $I_n$'s, say ${I_n}_(n=1)^N$, denoting $I_n = (a_n, b_n)$ (with relabelling, etc). Moreover, we can pick the $a_n, b_n$'s such that $a_1 < a, b_N > b$, and generally $a_n < b_(n-1) forall 2 <= n <= N$. Then, $
sum_(n=1)^infinity ell(I_n) gt.eq sum_(n=1)^N ell(I_n) &= b_1 - a_1 + sum_(n=2)^N (b_n - a_n)\
& >= b_1 - a_1 + sum_(n=2)^N (b_n - b_(n-1)) \
&= b_N - a_1 >= b- 1 = ell(I),
$ hence since the cover was arbitrary, $m^(ast) (A) >= ell(I)$, and equality holds.

Now, suppose $I$ finite, with endpoints $a < b$. Then for any $(b-a)/2 > epsilon > 0$, then $
[a + epsilon, b - epsilon] subset.eq I subset.eq [a - epsilon, b + epsilon],
$ hence by monotonicity and the previous part of this proof $
m^ast ([a + epsilon, b - epsilon]) = b - a -2epsilon <= m^ast (I) <= b - a + 2 epsilon = m^ast ([a - epsilon, b + epsilon]),
$ from which it follows that $m^ast (I) = b - a = ell(I)$.

Finally, suppose $I$ infinite. Then, $forall M >= 0, exists$ closed, finite interval $I_M$ with $I_M subset.eq I$ and $ell(I_M) >= M$. Hence, $m^ast (I) >= m^ast (I_M) >= M$ and thus as $M$ arbitrary it must be that $m^ast (I) = infinity = ell(I)$.

6. Denote $tilde(m) (A) := inf {m^ast (B) : A subset.eq B subset.eq RR, B - "open"}$. For any $A subset.eq B subset.eq RR$ with $B$ open, monotonicity gives that $m^ast (A) <= m^ast (B)$, hence $m^ast (A) <= tilde(m) (A)$. Conversely, assuming wlog $m^ast (A) < infinity$ (else holds trivially), then for all $epsilon > 0$, there exists ${I_n}$ such that $A subset.eq union.big_(n=1)^infinity I_n$ with $sum_(n=1)^infinity ell(I_n) <= m^ast (A) + epsilon$. Setting $B := union.big_(n=1)^infinity I_n$, we have that $A subset.eq B$ and $m^ast (B) = m^ast (union.big I_n) <=$ (by finite subadditivity) $sum_(n=1)^infinity m^ast (I_n) = sum_(n=1)^infinity ell(I_n) <= m^ast (A) + epsilon$  hence $m^ast (B) <= m^ast (A)$ for all $B$. Thus $m^ast (A) >= tilde(m)(A)$ and equality holds.

7. Put $delta := d(A_1, A_2) > 0$. Clearly $m^ast (A) <= m^ast (A_1) + m^ast (A_2)$ by finite subadditivity. wlog, $m^ast (A) < infinity$ (and hence $m^ast (A_i) < infinity, i = 1, 2$) (else holds trivially). Then $forall epsilon > 0, exists {I_n} : A subset.eq union.big I_n$ and $sum ell(I_n) <= m^ast (A) + epsilon$. Then, for all $n$, we consider a "refinement" of $I_n$; namely, let ${I_(n, i)}_(i >= 1)$ such that $I_n subset.eq union.big_(i) I_(n, i)$ and $ell(I_(n, i)) < delta$ and $sum_(i) ell(I_(n, i)) <= ell(I_n) + epsilon/(2^n)$. Relabel ${I_(n, i) : n, i >= 1} arrow.squiggly {J_m : m >= 1}$ (both are countable). Then, ${J_m}$ defines an open-interval cover of $A$, and since $ell(J_m) < delta$ for each $m$, $J_m$ intersects at most one $A_i$. For each $m$ and $p = 1, 2$, put $
M_p := {m : J_m sect A_p eq.not nothing},
$ noting that $M_1 sect M_2 = nothing$. Then ${J_m : m in M_p}$ is an open covering of $A_p$, and so $
m^ast (A_1) + m^ast (A_2) &<= sum_(m in M_1) ell(J_m) + sum_(m in M_2) ell(J_m) \
& <= sum_(m=1)^infinity ell(J_m) = sum_(n, i = 1)^infinity ell(I_n, i)\
& <= sum_(n) (ell(I_n) + epsilon/(2^n))\
& = sum_(n) ell(I_n) + epsilon \
& <= m^ast (A) + 2 epsilon,
$ and hence equality follows.
8. If $ell(J_k) = infinity$ for some $k$, then since $J_k subset.eq A$, subadditivity gives us that $m^ast (J_k) <= m^ast (A)$ and so $m^ast (A) = infinity = sum_(k=1)^infinity ell(J_k)$ (since if any $J_k$ infinite, the sum of the lengths of all of them will also be infinite).

Suppose then $ell(J_k) < infinity$ for all $k$. Fix $epsilon > 0$. Then for all $k >= 1$, choose $I_k subset.eq J_k$ such that $ell(J_k) <= ell(I_k) + epsilon/(2^k)$. For any $N >= 1$, we can choose a subset ${I_1, dots, I_N}$ of intervals such that all are disjoint, with strictly positive distance between them, and so $
union.big_(k=1)^N I_k subset.eq union.big_(k=1)^N I_k subset.eq A\
=> m^ast (A) >= m^ast (union.big_(k=1)^N I_k ) &>= sum_(k=1)^N ell(I_k) \
&>= sum_(k=1)^N (ell (J_k) - epsilon/(2^k))\
& >= sum_(k=1)^N ell(J_k) - epsilon\
implies m^ast (A) >= sum_(k=1)^infinity ell(J_k),
$ the second inequality following from finite subadditivity. The converse of the final inequality holds trivially.

== Lebesgue-Measurable Sets

m^ast (B) = m^ast (B sect A) + m^ast (B sect A^c).

#remark[

#theorem("Carathéodary's Theorem")[
  Let $
  cal(M) := {A subset.eq RR : A #h(0.5em) m^ast-"measurable"}.
  $ Then, $cal(M)$ is a $sigma$-algebra of subsets of $RR$.

  Define $m : cal(M) -> [0, infinity]$, $m(A) = m^ast (A)$. Then, $m$ is a measure on $cal(M)$, called the _Lebesgue measure_ on $RR$. We call sets in $cal(M)$ _Lebesgue-measurable_ or simply _measurable_ (if clear from context) accordingly. We call $(RR, cal(M), m)$ the _Lebesgue measure space_.
]

#proof[
The first two $sigma$-algebra axioms are easy. We have for any $B subset.eq RR$ that $
m^ast (B sect RR) + m^ast (B sect RR^c) = m^ast (B) + m^ast (B sect nothing) = m^ast (B)
$ so $RR in cal(M)$. Further, $A in cal(M) => A^c in cal(M)$ by the symmetry of the requirement for sets to be in $cal(M)$.

The final axiom takes more work. We show first $cal(M)$ closed under finite unions; by induction it suffices to show for $2$ sets. Let $A_1, A_2 in cal(M)$. Then, for all $B subset.eq RR$, $
m^ast (B) &= m^ast (B sect A_1) + m^ast (B sect A_1^c) \
&=  m^ast (B sect A_1) + m^ast (B sect A_1^c sect A_2) + m^ast (B sect A_1^c sect A_2^c)\
&=  m^ast (B sect A_1) + m^ast (B sect A_1^c sect A_2) + m^ast (B sect (A_1 union A_2)^c)
$ Note that $(B sect A_1) union (B sect A_1^c sect A_2^c) = B sect (A_1 union A_2)$, hence by subadditivity, $
m^ast (B) >= m^ast (B sect (A_1 union A_2)) + m^ast (B sect (A_1 union A_2)^c),
$ and since the other direction of the inequality comes for free, we conclude $A_1 union A_2 in cal(M)$.

Let now ${A_n} subset.eq cal(M)$. We "disjointify" ${A_n}$; put $B_1 := A_1$, $B_n := A_n \\ union.big_(i=1)^(n-1) A_i, n >= 2$, noting $union.big_n A_n = union.big_n B_n$, and each $B_n in cal(M)$, as each is but a finite number of set operations applied to the $A_n$'s, and thus in $cal(M)$ as demonstrated above. Put $E_n := union.big_(i=1)^n B_i$, noting again $E_n in cal(M)$. Then, for all $B subset.eq RR$, $
m^ast (B) &= m^ast (underbrace(B sect E_n, "chop up" B_n)) +m^ast ( underbrace(B sect E_n^c, E_n subset.eq union B_n => E_n^c supset.eq (union B_n)^c))\
&>= m^ast (B sect underbrace(E_n sect B_n, = B_n)) + m^ast (B sect underbrace(E_n sect B_n^c, = E_(n-1))) + m^ast (B sect (union.big_(n=1)^infinity B_n)^c)\
& >= m^ast (B sect B_n) + m^ast (underbrace(B sect E_(n-1), "chop up" B_(n-1))) + m^ast (B sect (union.big_(n=1)^infinity B_n)^c)\
& >= m^ast (B sect B_n) + m^ast (B sect E_(n-1) sect B_(n-1)) \
& #h(2em)+ m^ast (B sect E_(n-1) sect B_(n-1)^c) + m^ast (B sect (union.big_(n=1)^infinity B_n)^c).
$ Notice that the last line is essentially the second applied to $B_(n-1)$; hence, we have a repeating (essentially, "descending") pattern in this manner, which we repeat until $n -> 1$. We have, thus, that $
m^ast (B) >= sum_(i=1)^n [ m^ast (B sect B_i)] + m^ast (B sect (union.big_(n=1)^infinity B_n)^c),
$ so taking $n -> infinity$, $
m^ast (B) &>=  sum_(i=1)^infinity [ m^ast (B sect B_i)] + m^ast (B sect (union.big_(n=1)^infinity B_n)^c)\
& >= m^ast (B sect (union.big_(n=1)^infinity B_n)) + m^ast (B sect (union.big_(n=1)^infinity B_n)^c).
$ As usual, the inverse inequality comes for free, and thus we can conclude $union.big_(n=1)^infinity B_n$ also $m^ast$-measurable, and thus so is $union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n$. This proves $cal(M)$ a $sigma$-algebra.

We show now $m$ a measure. By previous propositions, we have that $m >= 0$ and $m(nothing) = 0$ (since $m = m^ast |_cal(M)$), so it remains to prove countable additivity.

Let ${A_n} subset.eq cal(M)$-disjoint. Following precisely the same argument as above, used to prove that $cal(M)$ closed under countable unions, shows that for any $n >= 1$ $
m (union.big_(i=1)^n A_i) = sum_(i=1)^n m(A_i),
$ that is, finite additivity holds, and thus by subadditivity $
m (union.big_(i=1)^infinity A_i) >= m (union.big_(i=1)^n A_i)  =sum_(i=1)^n m(A_i),
$ and so taking the limit of $n -> infinity$, we have 
$
m (union.big_(i=1)^infinity A_i) >= sum_(i=1)^infinity m(A_i),
$ with the converse inequality coming for free. Thus, $m$ indeed a measure on $cal(M)$.

For all $B subset.eq RR$, we have (since $m^ast$ translation invariant) $

#remark[Such a $c$ is simply $c = mu((0,1))$.]

To prove this proposition, we first introduce some helpful tooling:
#theorem([Dynkin's $pi$-d])[Given a space $X$, let $cal(C)$ be a collection of subsets of $X$. $cal(C)$ is called a _$pi$-system_ if $A, B in cal(C) => A sect B in cal(C)$ (that is, it is closed under finite intersections).

Let $cal(F) = sigma (cal(C))$, and suppose $mu_1, mu_2$ are two finite measures on $(X, cal(F))$ such that $mu_1 (X) = mu_2 (X)$ and $mu_1 = mu_2$ when restricted to $cal(C)$. Then, $mu_1 = mu_2$ on all of $cal(F)$.

#proposition[If $mu$ a measure on $(RR, frak(B)_RR)$ such that for all intervals $I$, $mu (I) = ell (I)$, then $mu = m$.]

#proof[Consider for all $n >= 1$ $mu|_(frak(B)_([-n,n]))$. Clearly, $mu ([-n, n]) = m([-n, n]) = 2n$, and for all $a, b in RR$, $mu((a, b) sect [-n,n]) = ell ((a, b) sect [-n, n]) = m((a, b) sect [-n, n])$. Thus, by the previous theorem, $mu$ must match $m$ on all of $frak(B)_([-n,n])$.

Let now $A in frak(B)_RR$. Let $A_n := A sect [-n, n] in frak(B)_([-n,n])$. By continuity of $m$ from below, $
mu(A) &= lim_(n-> infinity) mu(A_n)\

#lemma[$borel$ translation invariant; for any $A in borel, x in RR, A + x in borel$.]

#proof[
  We employ the "good set strategy"; fix some $x in RR$ and let $
  Sigma := {B in borel : B + x in borel}.
  $
  We have by construction $Sigma subset.eq borel$. One can check too that $Sigma$ a $sigma$-algebra. But in addition, its easy to see that ${(a, b) : a <b in RR} subset.eq Sigma$, since a translated interval is just another interval, and since these sets generate $borel$, it must be further that $borel subset.eq Sigma$, completing the proof.
]

#proof[(of the proposition) Let $c = mu((0, 1])$, noting that $c > 0$ (why? Consider what would happen if $c = 0$).

This implies that $forall n >= 1$, $mu ((0, 1/n]) = c/n$ (obtained by "chopping up" $(0, 1]$ into $n$ disjoint intervals); from here we can draw many further conclusions: $
&forall m = 1, dots, n - 1, mu((0, m/n]) = m/n c\
&=> forall q in QQ sect (0, 1], mu((0, q]) = q c\
&=> forall q in QQ^+, mu ((0, q]) = q dot c "(translate)"\
&=> forall a in RR, mu((a, a + q]) = q dot c\
&=> forall "intervals" I, mu(I) = c dot ell (I) "(continuity)"\
&=> forall n >= 1, a, b in RR, mu((a, b) sect [-n, n]) = c dot ell ((a, b) sect [-n, n]) = c dot m ((a, b) sect [-n, n]),
$
but then, $mu = c dot m$ on $borel_[-n,n]$, and by appealing again the Dynkin's, $mu = c dot m$ on all of $borel$.

#proposition("Scaling")[$m$ has the _scaling property_ that $forall A in cal(M)$, $c in RR$, $c dot A = {c x : x in A} in cal(M)$, and $m (c dot A) = |c| m(A)$.]

#proof[Assume $c eq.not 0$. Given $A subset.eq RR$, remark that ${I_n}$ an open interval cover of $A$ iff ${c I_n}$ and open interval cover of $c A$, and $ell (c I_n) = |c| ell(I_n)$, and thus $m^ast (c A) = |c| m^ast (A)$.

Now, suppose $A in cal(M)$. Then, we have for any $B subset.eq RR$, $
m^ast (B) = |c| m^ast (1/c B) &= |c| m^ast (1/c B sect A) + |c| m^ast (1/c B sect A^c)\
&= m^ast (B sect c A) + m^ast (B sect  (c A)^c),
$ so $c A in cal(M)$.

== Relationship between $borel$ and $cal(M)$

#definition[Given $(X, cal(F), mu)$, consider the following collection of subsets of $X$, $
cal(N) := {B subset.eq X : exists A in cal(F) "s.t." mu(A) =0, B subset.eq A}.
$ Put $overline(cal(F)) := sigma (cal(F) union cal(N))$; this is called the _completion_ of $cal(F)$ with respect to $mu$.
]

#proposition[$overline(cal(F)) = {F subset.eq X : exists E, G in cal(F) "s.t." exists E subset.eq F subset.eq G "and" m(G \\ E) = 0}$.]

#proof[
Put $cal(G)$ the set on the right; one can check $cal(G)$ a $sigma$-algebra. Since $cal(F) subset.eq cal(G)$  and $cal(N) subset.eq cal(G)$, we have $overline(cal(F)) subset.eq cal(G)$.

Conversely, for any $F in cal(G)$, we have $E, G in cal(F)$ such that $E subset.eq F subset.eq G$ with $m(G \\ E) = 0$. We can rewrite $
F = underbrace(E, in cal(F)) union underbrace((F \\ E), subset.eq G \\ E \ => mu (F \\ E )= 0 \ => G\\E in cal(N)),
$ hence $F in cal(F) union cal(N)$ and thus in $cal(F)$, and equality holds.
]

#definition[Given $(X, cal(F), mu)$, $mu$ can be _extended_ to $overline(cal(F))$ by, for each $F in overline(cal(F))$ with $E subset.eq F subset.eq G$ s.t. $mu(G\\E) = 0$, put $
mu(F) = mu(E) = mu(G).
$ We call then $(X, cal(F), mu)$ a _complete measure space_.]

#remark[It isn't obvious that this is well defined a priori; in particular, the $E, G$ sets are certainly not guaranteed to be unique in general, so one must check that this definition is valid regardless of choice of "sandwich sets".]

#theorem[$(RR, cal(M), m)$ is the completion of $(RR, borel, m)$.]

#proof[
  Given $A in cal(M)$, then $forall n >= 1, exists G_n$-open with $A subset.eq G_n$ s.t. $m^ast (G_n \\ A) <= 1/n$ and $exists F_n$-closed with $F_n subset.eq A$ s.t. $m^ast (A \\ F_n) <= 1/n$.

  Put $C := sect.big_(n=1)^infinity G_n$, $B := sect.big_(n=1)^infinity F_n$, remarking that $C, B in borel$, $B subset.eq A subset.eq C$, and moreover $
  m(C \\ A) <= 1/n, m(A \\ B) <= 1/n\
  => m(C \\ B) = m(C\\A) + m(A \\ B) <= 2/n,
  $
  but $n$ can be arbitrarily large, hence $m (C \\ B) = 0$; in short, given a measurable set, we can "sandwich it" arbitrarily closely with Borel sets. Thus, $A in overline(borel) => cal(M) subset.eq overline(borel)$. But recall that $cal(M)$ complete, so $borel subset.eq cal(M) => overline(borel) subset.eq overline(cal(M)) = cal(M)$, and thus $overline(borel) = cal(M)$ indeed.

  Heuristically, this means that any measurable set is "different" from a Borel set by at most a null set.
]

== Some Special Sets
=== Uncountable Null Set?

Remark that for any countable set $A in cal(M)$, $m(A) = 0$; indeed, one may write $A = union.big_(n=1)^infinity {a_n}$ for singleton sets ${a_n}$, and so $
m(A) = sum_(n=1)^infinity m(a_n) = 0.
$ One naturally asks the opposite question, does there exist a measurable, _uncountable_ set with measure 0? We construct a particular one here, the Cantor set, $C$.

This requires an "inductive" construction. Define $C_0 = [0, 1]$, and define $C_k$ to be $C_(k-1)$ after removing the middle third from each of its disjoint components. For instance $C_1 = [0, 1/3] union [2/3, 1]$, then $C_2 = [0, 1/9] union [2/9, 1/3] union [2/3, 7/9] union [8/9, 1]$, and so on. This may be clearest graphically:

#align(center,
  cetz.canvas({
    import cetz.draw: *
    line((0, 5), (5, 5))

    line((0, 4), (5/3, 4))
    line((2*5/3, 4), (2*5/3+5/3, 4))

    line((0, 3), (5/9, 3))
    line((2*5/9, 3), (2*5/9+5/9, 3))
    line((0+2*5/3, 3), (5/9+2*5/3, 3))
    line((2*5/9+2*5/3, 3), (2*5/9+5/9+2*5/3, 3))

    content((5/3/2, 2), $dots.v$)
    content((5-5/6, 2), $dots.v$)

    content((6, 5), $C_0$)
    content((6, 4), $C_1$)
    content((6, 3), $C_2$)
    content((6, 2), $dots.v$)
  })
)

 Remark that the $C_n arrow.b$. Put finally $
C := sect.big_(n=1)^infinity C_n.
$

#proposition[The following hold for the Cantor set $C$:

+ $C$ is closed (and thus $C in borel$);
+ $m(C) = 0$;
+ $C$ is uncountable.
]

#proof[
1. For each $n$, $C_n$ is the countable (indeed, finite) union of $2^n$-many disjoint, closed intervals, hence each $C_n$ closed. $C$ is thus a countable intersection of closed sets, and is thus itself closed.

2. For each $n$, each of the $2^n$ disjoint closed intervals in $C_n$ has length $1/3^n$, hence $
m(C_n) = 2^n / 3^n = (2/3)^n.
$ Since ${C_n} arrow.b$, by continuity of $m$ we have $
m(C) = lim_(n=> infinity) m(C_n) = lim_(n-> infinity) (2/3)^n = 0.
$

3. This part is a little trickier. Notice that for any $x in [0, 1]$, we can define a sequence $(a_n)$ where each $a_n in {0, 1, 2}$, and such that $
x = sum_(n=1)^infinity a_n/3^n;
$ in particular, this is just the base-3 representation of $x$, which we denote $(x)_3 = (a_1 a_2 dots.c)$.

I claim now that $
C = {x in [0, 1] : (x)_3 "has no" 1"'s"}.
$ Indeed, at each stage $n$ of the construction of the Cantor set, we get rid of the segment of the real line that would correspond to the $a_n = 1$. One should note that $(x)_3$ not necessarily unique; for instance $(1/3)_3 = (1, 0, 0, dots) = (0, 2, 2, dots)$, but if we specifically consider all $x$ such that there _exists_ a base three representation with no 1's, i.e. like $1/3$, then $C$ indeed captures all the desired numbers.

Thus, we have that $
"card"(C) = "card"({{ a_n} : a_n = 0, 2}).
$ Define now the function $
f : C -> [0, 1], #h(1em) x |-> sum_(n=1)^infinity a_n/2 dot 1/2^n, "where" (x)_3 = (a_n)
$ i.e., we "squish" the base-3 representation into a base-2 representation of a number. This is surjective; for any $y in [0, 1]$, $(b_n) := (y)_2$ contains only 0's and 1's, hence $(2 b_n)$ contains only $0$'s and $1$'s, so let $x$ be the number such that $(x)_3 = (2 b_n)$. This necessarily exists, indeed, we simply take our definitions backwards: $
x := sum_(n=1)^infinity (2 b_n)/3^n,
$ which maps to $y$ under $f$ and is contained in $C$. Hence, $"card"(C) >= "card"([0, 1])$; but $[0, 1]$ uncountable, and thus so is $C$.
]

We can naturally extend the function $f$ used here to map the entire interval $[0, 1] -> [0, 1]$ as follows $
f(x) := cases(
  sum_(n=1)^infinity a_n/2 dot.c 1/2^n "if" x in C\, (x)_3 = (a_n),
  f(a) "if" x in.not C "then" x in (a, b) "s.t." (a, b) "removed from " [0, 1]
).
$
This function is often called the _Devil's Staircase_ or _Cantor-Lebesgue function_.

#proposition[
  1. $f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f equiv 1/2$ on $(1/3, 2/3)$, $f equiv 1/4$ on $(1/9, 2/9)$
  2. $f : [0, 1] -> [0, 1]$ a surjection
  3. $f$ is nondecreasing
  4. $f$ is continuous
]

#proof[
  1., 2., clear from construction. 
  
  For 3., let $x_1 < x_2 in C$, and suppose $(x_1)_3 = (a_n), (x_2)_3 = (b_n)$. Then, since $x_1 < x_2$, it must be that $a_n, b_n$ can only be equal up to some finite $N$; then the next $0 = a_(N+1) < b_(N+1) = 2$. Hence, it follows that the "modified binary expansion" that arises from $f$ gives directly that $f(x_1) <= f(x_2)$.

  For 4., $f$ is clearly continuous on $[0,1] minus C$, since it is piecewise-constant here. Also, $f$ is "one-sided continuous" at each of the "boundary points" $1/3, 2/3, 1/9, 2/9, dots$. If $x in C$, for any $n >=1 $, there must be $x_n, x_n '$ such that $x_n < x < x_n '$ (if $x = 0$, only need $x_n '$, if $x = 1$, only need $x_n$) and $f(x_n ') - f(x_n) <= 1/2^n$. Then, $f$ is continuous at $x$ by monotonicity of $f$.
]

=== Non-Measurable Sets?
We've shown then that there is indeed an uncountable set of measure 0. Another question we may ask ourselves is, is there a $A subset.eq RR$ that is non-measurable? The answer to this turns out to be yes, but the construction requires invoking the axiom of choice:

#axiom("Of Choice")[If $Sigma$ a collection of nonempty sets, then $exists$ a function $
S : Sigma -> union.big_(A in Sigma) A,
$ such that $A in sigma$, $S(A) in A$. Such a function is called a _selection function_, and $S(A)$ a _representative_ of $A$.]

We construct now a non-measurable set, assuming the above. Consider $[0, 1]$, and define an equivalence relation $tilde$ on $[0, 1]$ by $
a tilde b <=> a - b in QQ.
$ Its easy to check that this is indeed an equivalence relation. Denote by $E_a$ the equivalence class containing $a$, and set $Sigma = {E_a : a in [0, 1]}$. Note that for any $E_a in Sigma, E_a eq.not nothing$. 

Invoking the axiom of choice, we can select exactly one element $S_a$ from $E_a$ for each $E_a in Sigma$. Set $
N := {S_a : S_a "is a representative of " E_a, E_a in Sigma}.
$

#proposition[
  $N$, called a _Vitali set_, is non-measurable.
]

#proof[
  Assume towards a contradiction that $N$ indeed measurable, $N in cal(M)$. Consider $[-1, 1] sect QQ$; this is countable, so we can enumerate it ${q_k}$, $k >=1$. For each $k$, put $
  N_k := N + q_k.
  $ By the assumption of measurability and translation invariance of $m$, it must be that each $N_k$ measurable and has the same measure as $N$.

  We claim each $N_k$ disjoint. Assume not, then $exists k eq.not ell$ (i.e. $q_k eq.not q_ell$) and $S_a, S_b in N$ such that $S_a + q_k = S_b + q_ell$. But then $S_a - S_b = q_ell - q_k in QQ$, hence $S_a tilde S_b$. But we constructed $N$ to have only one representative from each equivalence class, hence it must be that $S_a = S_b$, and so $S_a + q_k = S_a + q_ell => q_k = q_ell$, contradicting the assumed distinctness of the $q$'s; hence, the $N_k$'s indeed disjoint.

  We claim next that $[0, 1] subset.eq union.big_(k=1)^infinity N_k$. Let $x in [0, 1]$. Then, $x tilde S_a$ for some unique $S_a in N$ and so $x - S_a in QQ$. But also, $x, S_a in [0, 1]$, hence $x - S_a in [-1, 1]$ (moreover, $x - S_a in [-1, 1] sect QQ$) and there must exist a $k$ such that $x - S_a = q_k$, since the $q_k$'s enumerate the entire $[-1, 1] sect QQ$. Thus, $x in N_k$ by the construction of the $N_k$'s. Thus, $[0, 1] subset.eq union.big_(n=1)^infinity N_k$ indeed.

  On the other hand, $union.big_(k=1)^infinity N_k subset.eq [-1, 2]$ and so we have the "bound" $
  [0, 1] subset.eq union.big_(n=1)^infinity N_k subset.eq [-1, 2].
  $ Taking the measure of all sides then, we have the bound $
  1 <= mu (union.big_(n=1)^infinity N_k) <= 3.
  $ Invoking the disjointness of the $N_k$'s, we can also use countable additivity to write $
  mu (union.big_(n=1)^infinity N_k) = sum_(k=1)^infinity m(N_k) = sum_(k=1)^infinity m(N),
  $ but this final line is a sequence of positive, constant real numbers; hence, it is impossible for it to be within $1$ and $3$, and we have a contradiction. Hence, $N$ indeed not measurable.

  Remark that this proof also shows that $m^ast (N_k) > 0$ so $m^ast (N) > 0$ (given the interval bound on $N$ we've found).
]

#proposition[
  For every $A in cal(M)$ such that $m(A) > 0$, there exists $B subset.eq A$ such that $B$ is non-measurable.
]

#proof[
  Assume otherwise, that there is a $A in cal(M)$ with $m(A) > 0$ such that any subset $B$ of $A$ is also measurable.

  Remark that $A subset.eq union.big_(n in ZZ) A sect [n, n + 1]$. Then, there exists an $n$ such that $m ( A sect [n, n + 1]) > 0$ and thus, translating $A' := A sect [n, n + 1] - n)$, $m(A') > 0$, noting that $A' subset.eq [0, 1]$. Now, for any $B'subset.eq A'$, $B' + n subset.eq A$. By assumption, then $B' + n$ must be measurable so $B'$ measurable.

  In summary, then, we have $A' subset.eq [0, 1]$ with $m (A') > 0$ such that (by assumption) $B'$ measurable for all $B' subset.eq A'$.

  Let $N, {q_k}, N_k$ be as in the previous proof. Set $
  A_k ' := A' sect N_k, k >= 1.
  $ Then, $A_k '$ disjoint, and $
  A' = [0, 1] sect A' subset.eq union.big_(k=1)^infinity (N_k sect A') = union.big_(k=1)^infinity A_k'.
  $ Since $m(A') > 0$, there exists a $k$ such that $m(A_k ') > 0$. Set, for this $k$, $
  L := {ell >= 1 : q_ell + q_k in [-1, 1]}.
  $ This set is again countably infinite. We translate, obtaining a disjoint sequence of sets ${q_ell + A_k ' : ell in L}$; since $q_ell + q_k in [-1, 1] sect QQ$, then $q_ell + q_k = q_m$ for some unique $m$, and so $q_ell + A_k ' = q_ell + A' sect (N + q_k) subset.eq N_m$. Hence, we have on the one hand that by countable additivity $
  union.big_(ell in L) (q_ell + A_k ') subset.eq [-1, 2] => sum_(ell in L) m(q_ell + A_k ') <= 3,
  $ and so it must be that $m(q_ell + A_k ') = m(A_k ') = 0$ (else the series couldn't be finite), contradicting the finiteness assumption on $m(A_k ')$.
]

=== Non-Borel Measurable Set?
We may ask, is there $A in cal(M)$ such that $A in.not borel$?

Let $f : [0, 1] -> [0, 1]$ be the Cantor-Lebesgue function, and put $g(x) = f(x) + x$; note that $g$ is continuous and strictly increasing, and is defined $g : [0, 1] -> [0, 2]$. Remark that $g$ bijective; the strictly increasing gives injective, and moreover $g(0) = 0, g(1) = 2$ hence by intermediate value theorem it is surjective. Hence, $g^(-1) : [0, 2] -> [0, 1]$ exists, and is also continuous, so in short $g$ is a homeomorphism; it maps open to open, closed to closed. In particular, if $A in borel$, then $g(A) in borel$.

Recall that if $(a, b)$ an open interval that gets removed from the construction of $C$, then $f$ is constant and so $g$ will map $(a, b)$ to another open interval of the same length $b - a$. Thus, $
m(g([0, 1] \\ C)) = m([0, 1] \\ C) = 1.
$

Hence, $m(g(C)) = 2 - 1 = 1 > 0$, since $g (C union [0, 1]\\C) = [0, 2]$. Hence, there exists a $B subset.eq g(C)$ such that $B in.not cal(M)$, as per the previous proposition.

Let $A := g^(-1) (B)$; then $A subset.eq g^(-1) (g (C))= C$. Since $m(C) = 0$, $A in cal(M)$ and $m(A) = 0$. But, $A in.not borel$; if it were, then $g(A) = B in borel$, since $g$ "maintains" Borel sets, but $B$ is not even Lebesgue measurable and so this is a contradiction).

== Measurable Functions

We will be considering functions $f$ defined on $RR$ or some subset of $RR$ that could take positive or negative infinity as its value i.e. $
f : RR -> overline(RR) := RR union {- infinity, infinity},
$ where $overline(RR)$ the _extended real line_; we say $f$ is $overline(RR)$-valued. If $f$ never takes $infinity, -infinity$ for any $x in RR$, we say $f$ finite-valued, or just $RR$-valued.

For all $a in RR$, we consider inverse images $
f^(-1) ([-infinity, a)) := {x in RR : f(x) in [-infinity, a)} = {f < a},
$ remarking the inclusion of $-infinity$; similarly $
f^(-1) ((a, infinity]) :=  {x in RR : f(x) in (a, infinity]} = {f > a},
$ and so on, for any $B subset.eq RR$, $
f^(-1)(B) := {x in RR : f(x) in B} = {f in B}.
$ Remark that $
f^(-1) (B^c) &= (f^(-1) (B))^c\
f^(-1) (A sect B) &= f^(-1) (A) sect f^(-1) (B)\
f^(-1) (A union B) &= f^(-1) (A) union f^(-1) (B),
$ which extend naturally for countable unions/intersections.

  For every $a in RR$, we may write $

#proof[
  To show $sup_n f_n$ measurable, we will show for all $a in RR$ ${sup_n f_n <= a} in cal(M)$. $
  x in {sup_n f_n <= a} &<=> sup_n f_n (x) <= a <=> f_n (x) <= a forall n >= 1 <=> x in sect.big_(n=1)^infinity {f_n <= a},
  $ hence ${sup_n f_n <= a} = sect.big_(n=1)^infinity underbrace({f_n <= a}, in cal(M)) in cal(M)$ and hence $sup_n f_n$ is measurable. Note that using $<=$ was important; ${sup_n f_n < a} subset.neq sect.big_(n=1)^infinity {f_n < a}$, since the $sup_n f_n$ could equal $a$. We could say the following, however: $
  {sup_n f_n < a} = union.big_(k=1)^infinity {sup_n f_n <= a - 1/k} = union.big_(k=1)^infinity sect.big_(n=1)^infinity {f_n <= a - 1/k} in cal(M).
  $ Next, we have $inf_n f_n = - sup_n (- f_n)$ so we are done. // TODO compare {inf fn < a} and union {f_n < a} and the same with equalities

  For $limsup, liminf$, we have $
  limsup_n f_n = inf_(m >= 1) underbrace(sup_(n >= m) f_n, := g_m).
  $ $g_m$ is measurable for each $m >= 1$, hence $inf_m g_m$ is measurable, hence $limsup_n f_n$ is measurable. Similar logic follows for $liminf$.

  We could have show, more directly, that $
  {limsup_n f_n < a}&= {inf_(m >= 1) sup_(n>= m) f_n < a}\
  &= union.big_(m=1)^infinity {sup_(n>=m)  f_n < a}\
  &= union.big_(m=1)^infinity union.big_(k=1)^infinity {sup_(n>=m)  f_n <= a- 1/k}\ // turn strict inequality into nonstrict inequality!!
  &= union.big_(m=1)^infinity union.big_(k=1)^infinity sect.big_(n=m)^infinity { f_n <= a- 1/k}.
  $
  // TODO express {limsup f_n <, <= a} as a set, etc.

#proposition[

  $ Moreover, if $lim_(n->infinity) f_n$ exists (in $RR$ or as $plus.minus infinity$) a.e. with $f = lim_(n->infinity) f_n$ a.e. then $f$ is measurable.

== Approximation by Simple Functions

Given a function $f : RR -> RRR$, measurable, we may write $
f = f^plus - f^minus,
$ where $f^plus, f^minus$ are non-negative measurable functions; so, it suffices to study non-negative measurable functions. For any $n >= 1$, we have $
f_n^plus := (f^plus and n) dot bb(1)_([-n,n]),
$ i.e., we cap $f^plus$ at $n$, and disregard values of $f^plus$ outside of $[-n, n]$; hence we limit our view to a $2 n times n$ "box". Then, $f_n^plus$ is non-negative, measurable, bounded (by $n$), compactly supported (zero outside a bounded set), and in particular $f_n^plus arrow.t$, with limit $
lim_(n-> infinity) f_n^plus = f^plus.
$ An identical construction follows for $f^minus$ with $
f_n^minus := (f^minus and n) bb(1)_([-n,n]),
$ with $f_n^minus arrow.t$ and $
lim_(n->infinity) f_n^minus = f^minus.
$ Fix some $n$ and consider $f_n^plus$. For $k = 0, 1, 2, dots, 2^n n$, define $
A_(n, k) := {x in [-n,n] : k/(2^n) <= f_n^plus (x) < (k+1)/(2^n)} = {k/(2^n) <= f_n^plus <(k+1)/(2^n) } sect [-n, n]  in cal(M),
$ noting that $A_(n, k) sect A_(n, ell) = nothing$ if $k eq.not ell$. Set now $
phi_n := sum_(k=0)^(n dot 2^n) bb(1)_(A_(n,k)) k/(2^n) = sum_(k=0)^(n dot 2^n) cases(k/(2^n) "if in" A_(n,k), 0 "else").
$ We call $phi_n$ a "simple function"; more generally:

#definition[ $phi$ is a _simple function_ if $phi = sum_(k=1)^L bb(1)_(E_k) dot a_k$ where $L$ a positive integer, $a_k$'s are constant, $E_k$'s are measurable sets of finite measure.]

Moreover, note that $phi_n arrow.t$; at each new stage $n -> n+1$, the regions are cut in two, $A_(n, k) = A_(n + 1, 2k) union A_(n+1, 2k + 1)$. In addition, we have $phi_n <= f_(n)^plus <= f^plus$ for all $n$. Moreover, we have the following: 
#proposition[$
lim_(n->infinity) phi_n (x) = f^plus (x) $ for all $x in RR$.
]
#proof[
For all $x in RR$, for sufficiently large $n$ we have that $x in [-n ,n]$ and so $f^(plus) (x) = f^plus (x) bb(1)_([-n,n]) (x)$. Assume for now $f^(plus) < infinity$. Then, for sufficiently large(r?) $n$, we can ensure $f^(plus) (x) < n$ and so $f^(plus) (x) = f_(n)^plus (x)$ for such an $x$. Further, we have that $x in A_(n, k)$ for some $k$ so $phi_n (x) = k/(2^n)$ and $f_n^+ (x) < (k+1)/(2^n)$ and thus $
0 <= f_(n)^plus (x) - phi_n (x) < (k+1)/(2^n) - k/(2^n) = 2^(-n)
$ by construction and so $0 <= f^(plus) (x) - phi_n (x) <= 2^(-n)$ and thus $lim_(n->infinity) phi_n (x) = f^plus (x)$.

In the case that $f^(plus) (x) = infinity$, then $phi_n (x) = n$ for all sufficiently large $n$ hence $
lim_(n -> infinity) phi_n (x) = lim_(n->infinity) n = infinity = f^(plus) (x).
$

#theorem[If $g$ is measurable and non-negative, there exists a sequence of simple functions ${phi_n}$ such that $phi_n arrow.t$ and $lim_(n->infinity) phi_n (x) = g(x)$ for every $x in RR$.]

We can repeat this same construction and proof for $f^minus$ with a sequence $tilde(phi_n)$. Even better:

#theorem[If $f$ is measurable, then $exists$ a sequence of simple functions ${psi_n}$ such that $|psi_n| arrow.t$ and $|psi_n| <= |f|$ for all $n$ and for all $x in RR$, $lim_(n->infinity) psi_n (x) = f(x)$.]

#proof[
  Take $psi_n = phi_n - tilde(phi_n)$ as above; then for all $x in RR$, at least one of $phi_n (x), tilde(phi_n) (x)$ equals zero. Then $
  abs(psi_n) = phi_n + tilde(phi_n) < f^plus + f^minus = |f|,
  $ and $
  lim_(n->infinity) psi_n (x) = lim_(n -> infinity) phi_n (x) - lim_(n -> infinity) tilde(phi_n) (x) = f^plus - f^minus = f.
  $
]

#definition("Step Function")[
$theta$ a _step function_ if it takes the form $
theta (x) = sum_(k=1)^L a_k bb(1)_(I_k) (x),
$ where $L in NN, a_k$'s constant, and $I_k$ finite, open intervals.
]

#theorem[
  If $f$ is measurable, then there exists a sequence of step functions ${theta_n}$ such that $
  lim_(n->infinity) theta_n (x) = f(x) "for" bold("almost every") x in RR.
  $ In particular, we do not have pointwise convergence as for general simple functions, but we have convergence outside a zero-measure set.
]

#proof[
  Assume, wlog, that $f$ non-negative (by the previous construction, we can "split" $f$ if not and approximate its positive, negative parts). Given $A in cal(M)$ with finite measure, recall that for every $epsilon > 0$, there exists finitely many finite open intervals $I_1, dots, I_N$ such that $
  m(A triangle.t (union.big_(i=1)^N I_i))  < epsilon.
  $ By renaming/rearranging $I_i$'s if necessary, we may assume that $I_i$'s are disjoint; hence $
  bb(1)_(union.big_(i=1)^N I_i) = sum_(i=1)^N bb(1)_(I_i).
  $ Put $
    theta_A := sum_(i=1)^N bb(1)_(I_i),
  $ noting this is indeed a step function as the name suggests. Then, remark that $
  m underbrace(({ x in RR : bb(1)_A (x) eq.not theta_A (x)}), = A triangle.t (union.big_(n=1)^N I_i)) < epsilon.
  $ Since $f$ measurable and non-negative, $exists {phi_n}$ sequence of simple functions with limit $f$. In particular, $
  phi_n = sum_(k=0)^(n 2^n) k/(2^n) bb(1)_(A_(n, k)).
  $ Applying our above analysis to each $A_(n, k)$, then, we have that for any $n >= 1$ and $k = 0, 1, dots, n 2^(n)$ we can find a step function $theta_(n, k)$ such that $
  m ({ x in RR : bb(1)_(A_(n, k)) eq.not theta_(n, k) (x)}) < 1/(2^n (n 2^n + 1)) thin thin (\" = epsilon \").
  $ Put then $
  theta_n :=  sum_(k=0)^(n 2^n) k/(2^n) theta_(n, k),
  $ which is itself a step function. Put $
  E_n := {x in RR : theta_n (x) eq.not phi_n (x)}.
  $ Then, $
  m(E_n) <= m(union.big_(k=0)^(n 2^n) {theta_(n, k) eq.not bb(1)_(A_(n, k))}) <= sum_(k=0)^(n 2^n) m({theta_(n, k) eq.not bb(1)_(A_(n,k))}) <= 2^(-n).
  $ The $phi_n$'s are chosen such that $forall x in RR$, $|phi_n (x) - f_n (x)| <= 1/(2^n)$. Putting $
  F_n := {x in RR : |theta_n (x) - f_n (x) | > 2^(-n)},
  $ then remark that $F_n subset.eq E_n$ so $m(F_n) <= 1/(2^n)$. 

  We claim now that for a.e. $x in RR$, $exists m >= 1$ such that $forall n >= m$, $|theta_n (x) - f_n (x)| <= 1/(2^n)$, remarking that such an $m$ is _dependent_ on $x$. Consider the complement of this statement; if this set has measure 0, we are done. The logical negation would be "for every $m >= 1$, exist $n >= m$ such that $|theta_n (x) - f_n (x) | > 2^(-n)$", which is equivalent to the set $
  sect.big_(m=1)^infinity union.big_(n=m)^infinity { x in RR : |theta_n (x) - f_n (x)| > 2^(-n)} = sect.big_(m=1)^infinity union.big_(n=m)^infinity F_n.
  $ Let $B_m := union.big_(n=m)^infinity F_n$; notice $B_m arrow.b$. Then, by continuity from above $thin^(ast ast ast ast)$
  // TODO some issues if infinite here
   $
  m( sect.big_(m=1)^infinity union.big_(n=m)^infinity F_n) = lim_(m->infinity) m(B_m) <= lim_(m-> infinity) sum_(n=m)^infinity m(F_n) <= lim_(m-> infinity) sum_(n=m)^infinity 1/(2^n) = 0,
  $ since the tail of a convergent series must converge to zero. Hence, the set has measure 0 as desired so for almost every $x in RR$ there exists $m >= 1$ such that for all $n >= m$, $|theta_n - f_n| <= 1/(2^n)$, hence almost every where $lim_(n->infinity)( theta_n - f_n) = 0$. Therefore, almost everywhere, $
  theta_n = (theta_n - f_n) + f_n -->^(n-> infinity) f.
  $
]
In this proof, we have proven (and then used) more generally:

#lemma("Borel-Cantelli Lemma")[
  If ${F_n} subset.eq cal(M)$ such that $sum_(n=1)^infinity m(F_n) < infinity$, then $
  m(sect.big_(m=1)^infinity union.big_(n=m)^infinity F_n) = 0.
  $
]

#proof[
  Remark that $union.big_(n=m)^infinity F_n$ a decreasing sequence of functions indexed by $m$. By continuity of the measure and subadditivity, $
  m(sect.big_(m=1)^infinity union.big_(n=m)^infinity F_n) = lim_(m->infinity) m(union.big_(n=m)^infinity F_n) <= lim_(m->infinity) sum_(n=m)^infinity m(F_n) = 0,
  $ since the tail of a converging sequence must converge to zero.

Similarly, we say $f_n -> f$ in measure on $A$ if $forall delta > 0$, $lim_(n->infinity) m({x in A : |f_n (x) - f(0)| >= delta}) =0$.

#proposition[
  Given finite-valued measurable functions ${f_n}, f$ and $A in cal(M)$ with finite measure, then if $f_n -> f$ a.e. on $A$, then $f_n -> f$ in measure on $A$.
]

#proof[
  For all $delta > 0$, $
  sect.big_(m=1)^infinity union.big_(n=m) {x in A : |f_n (x) - f(x)| > delta} subset.eq {x in A : lim_(n->infinity) f_n (x) eq.not f(x)}.
  $ The set on the RHS has measure zero and thus so does the left one. Then, $
  lim_(m -> infinity) m(union.big_(n=m) {x in A : |f_n (x) - f(x)| > delta}) = 0
  $ by continuity, and $
  {|f_m - f| > delta} subset.eq union.big_(n =m)^infinity {|f_n - f| > delta}
  $ hence $m({|f_m - f| > delta}) <= m(union.big_(n =m)^infinity {|f_n - f| > delta}) -->^(m-> infinity) 0$.
]

#example[
We give an example of why the assumption that $m(A) < infinity$ is necessary. Let, $f_n = bb(1)_([n, infinity))$ and $f equiv 0$. Then, $lim_(n->infinity) f_n (x) = f(x)$ for every $x in RR$. But $m({x in RR : |f_n (x) - f(x)| = 1}) = m([n, infinity)) = infinity$.

In general, the converse statement $f_n -> f$ in measure does _not_ imply that $f_n -> f$ almost everywhere, even on finite measure sets. Put $phi_(1, 1) = bb(1)_([0, 1))$, $phi_(2, 1) = bb(1)_([0, 1/2))$, $phi_(2, 2) = bb(1)_([1/2, 1))$, $phi_(3, 1) = bb(1)_([0, 1/3))$, $phi_(3, 2) = bb(1)_([1/3, 2/3))$, $phi_(3, 3) = bb(1)_([2/3, 1))$, or in general $phi_(k, j) = bb(1)_([(j-1)/k, j/k))$ for $j = 1, dots, k$. Reorder $phi_(k, j)$ "lexicographically" into ${f_n}$. Then, we claim $f_n -> 0$ in measure on $[0, 1)$; for any $delta in (0, 1)$, $
m ({|f_n - 0| > delta}) = 1/
(k(n)) -> 0,
$ where $k(n)$ the "row" that $f_n$ comes from. Hence, $f_n$ converges in measure. However, $f_n$ does not converge almost eveywhere on $[0, 1)$. Indeed, for each $x in RR$ and $k >= 1$, there exists a _unique_ $j$ such that $x in [(j-1)/k, j/k]$ hence $phi_(k,j) (x) = 1$, so in other notation there always exists an $n$ such that $f_n (x) = 1$, and so precisely $f_n (x) = 1$ for infinitely many $n$. Hence, we do not have convergence everywhere (in fact, anywhere).

#proof[
  Assume $f_n -> f$ in measure, that is for every $delta > 0$, $m({|f_n - f| > delta}) -> 0$. Hence, for all $k >= 1$, with $delta = 1/k$, we have that for some sufficiently large $n_k$, we have that $m(underbrace({|f_(n_k) - f| > 1/k}, := A_k)) <= 1/(k^2)$, hence $sum_(k=1)^infinity m(A_k) < infinity$. Hence, $
  m(sect.big_(ell=1)^infinity union.big_(k=ell)^infinity A_k) = lim_(ell -> infinity) m(union.big_(k=ell)^infinity A_k) <= lim_(ell -> infinity) sum_(k=ell)^infinity m(A_k) = 0,
  $ since $sum_(k=ell)^infinity m(A_k)$ the tail of a converging series. Hence, complementing the above, a.e. there $exists ell$ such that for every $k >= ell$, $|f_(n_k) - f| <= 1/k$ and so $lim_(k->infinity) |f_(n_k) - f| = 0$ almost everywhere, and so $f_(n_k) -> f$ a.e. (as $k-> infinity$).

== Egorov's Theorem and Lusin's Theorem

Recall that if $f$ is measurable, then $exists {theta_n}$ sequence of step functions such that $theta_n -> f$ almost everywhere.

#theorem("Egorov's")[
  Given ${f_n}$, $f$ measurable functions and $A in cal(M)$ with $m(A) < infinity$, if $f_n -> f$ a.e. on $A$, then $forall epsilon > 0$, there exists a closed subset $A_epsilon subset.eq A$ with $m(A \\ A_epsilon) <= epsilon$ such that $f_n -> f$ uniformly on $A_epsilon$.
]

#proof[
  We assume first $f$ is finite-valued on $A$ (otherwise, replace $A$ with $A sect {-infinity < f < infinity}$; we'll deal with ${f = plus.minus infinity}$ later). We want to show that $forall epsilon > 0, exists$ closed $A_epsilon subset.eq A$ s.t. $m(A \\ A_epsilon) < epsilon$ _and_ $sup_(x in A_epsilon) |f_n (x) - f(x)| -> 0$ as $n -> infinity$.

  For each $k >= 1$ and $n >= 1$, put $
  E^((k))_n := {x in A : |f_j (x) - f(x)| <= 1/k forall j >= n}.
  $ For fixed $k$, remark that $E_n^((k)) subset.eq E_(n+1)^((k))$, i.e. $E_n^((k))$ increasing (wrt $n$), so we may consider $
  union.big_(n=1)^infinity E_(n)^((k)) = {x in A : exists n >= 1 "s.t." forall j >= n, |f_j (x) - f(x) | <= 1/k} supset.eq {x in A : lim_(n->infinity) f_n (x) = f(x)} =: A'.
  $ By assumption, $m(A') = m(A)$, so by continuity and the superset relation above, $m(A) = m(A') <= m(union.big_(n=1)^infinity E_(n)^((k))) = lim_(n->infinity) m(E_(n)^((k))) <= m(A)$, and thus $lim_(n->infinity) m(E_(n)^((k))) = m(A)$ for every $k >= 1$.

  Given, then, any $epsilon > 0$, there exists a $n_k$ such that $m(A \\ E_(n_k)^((k))) = m(A) -  m(E_(n_k)^((k))) < 1/(2^k) epsilon/2$. Set $
  B := A \\ (sect.big_(k=1)^infinity E_(n_k)^((k))),
  $ then $
  m(B) = m(union.big_(k=1)^infinity A \\ E_(n_k)^((k))) <= sum_(k=1)^infinity m(A \\ E_(n_k)^((k))) <= epsilon/2.
  $ Put $
  tilde(A) := A \\ B = sect.big_(k=1)^infinity E_(n_k)^((k)). 
  $ Then, if $x in tilde(A)$, then $x in E_(n_k)^((k))$ for every $k$, and hence for every $k >= 1$ and $j >= n_k$, $|f_j (x) - f(x)| <= 1/k$. This shows then that $f_n -> f$ uniformly on $tilde(A)$. By regularity of $m$, there exists a closed $A_(epsilon) subset.eq tilde(A)$ such that $m(tilde(A) \\ A_epsilon) <= epsilon/2$. Then, $f_n -> f$ uniformly on $A_epsilon$, and $m(A \\ A_epsilon) = m(A\\ tilde(A)) + m(tilde(A) \\ A_epsilon) < epsilon$.

  Now, if $f = infinity\/-infinity$ on $A$, then $A = A^(infinity) union A^(-infinity) union A^RR$ (with $A^bullet := {f = bullet} sect A$). The last case is done. For $A^infinity$ (similar construction for $A^(-infinity)$), define for every $k$, $n >= 1$,$
  E_n^((k)) := {x in A : f_j (x) > k forall j >= n}.
  $ Then, the remainder of the proof follows precisely the same for the sequence of sets $E_(n)^((k))$.
]

#remark[
  1. The assumption $m(A) < infinity$ is necessary. For instance $f_n = bb(1)_([n, infinity)) -> 0$ pointwise, but for any $a in RR$, $f_n$ does not converge to $0$ uniformly on $(a, infinity)$.
  2. In general, Egorov's $arrow.double.not f_n -> f$ uniformly a.e.. For instance, on $[0, 1]$, let $f_n (x) = x^n$ and $f(x) equiv 0$. For every $x in [0, 1)$, $f_n (x) -> f(x)$ as $n -> infinity$. Hence, $f_n -> f$ a.e. on $[0, 1]$ (the only point that doesn't converge, indeed, is at $1$). If $A subset.eq [0, 1]$ is closed such that $1 in A$, then $f_n arrow.not f$ uniformly on $A$. To see this, let ${x_m} subset.eq A$ such that $x_m arrow.t$ and $lim_(m->infinity) x_m = 1$. Then, for any fixed $n$, $
  sup_(x in A)|f_n (x) - f(x)| >= sup_(m)|f_n (x_m) - f(x_m)| = sup_m x_m^n = 1,
  $ hence $f_n$ does not converge uniformly on $A$.
]

#theorem("Lusin's Theorem")[
  Given $f$ measurable and finite-valued and $A in cal(M)$ with $m(A) < infinity$, for all $epsilon > 0$, there exists a closed $A_epsilon subset.eq A$ with $m(A\\A_epsilon) < epsilon$ such that $f|_(A_epsilon)$ is continuous.
]

#remark[Lusin's Theorem states that $f|_(A_(epsilon))$ is continuous as a function on $A_epsilon$, which is _not_ the same as saying $f$ as a function on $A$ is continuous at points in $A_epsilon$.

For instance, $f = bb(1)_(QQ sect [0, 1])$ is not continuous anywhere on $[0, 1]$. However, $f|_(QQ sect [0, 1])$ is constant and therefore continuous _on_ $QQ sect [0, 1]$.
]

#proof[
  Let ${theta_n}$ be a sequence of step functions such that $theta_n -> f$ a.e. on $A$. Note that $theta_n$ piecewise constant and hence piecewise continuous. Given $epsilon > 0$ and $n >= 1$, we can find an open set $E_n$ such that $theta_n|_(E_n^c)$ is continuous and $m(E_n) <= epsilon/2 1/2^n$. Meanwhile, Egorov's implies that there exists a closed $B subset.eq A$ such that $m(A \\ B) <= epsilon/2$ such that $theta_n -> f$ uniformly on $B$. Set $
  A_epsilon = B \\ union.big_(n=1)^infinity E_n,
  $ noting that $A_epsilon subset A$ closed and $
  m(A\\A_epsilon) = m(A\\B) + m(union.big_(n=1)^infinity E_n) =  epsilon/2 + sum_(n=1)^infinity m(E_m) <= epsilon.
  $ Finally, on $A_epsilon$, $theta_n -> f$ uniformly and $theta_n|_(A_epsilon)$ continuous, and hence $f|_(A_epsilon)$ continuous (uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous).
]

#remark[
  1. Lusin's Theorem $arrow.double.not$ $f$ is continuous almost everywhere in general. For instance, recall that fat Cantor set $tilde(C)$, with $m(tilde(C)) = 1/2$. Let $f = bb(1)_tilde(C)$. $f$ is NOT continuous a.e. on $[0, 1]$, i.e. $forall B subset.eq [0, 1]$ with $m(B) = 1$, $f|_B$ is NOT continuous. To see this, let $tilde(D) = [0, 1] \\ tilde(C)$. Since $m(B) = 1$, then $m(tilde(C) sect B) = m(tilde(D) sect B) = 1/2$. Then for any $x in tilde(C) sect B$, $f|_B$ is NOT continuous at $x$. If it were at say some $x_0 in tilde(C) sect B$,  then there must exist some $delta > 0$ such that for any $x in (x_0 - delta, x_0 + delta) sect B$, $|f(x) - f(x_0)| < 1/2$. Hence, for any $x in (x_0 - delta, x_0 + delta) sect B$, $1/2 <= f(x) <= 3/2$. However, $m((x_0 - delta, x_0 + delta) sect B sect tilde(D)) > 0$ so it must be that $exists y in (x_0 - delta, x_0 + delta) sect B sect tilde(D) => f(y) = 0$, a contradiction. How, then, does one apply Lusin's; that is, $forall epsilon > 0$, there must exist some $A_epsilon subset.eq [0, 1]$ such that $m([0, 1] \\ A_epsilon) < epsilon$ and $f|_(A_epsilon) < epsilon$ (exercise)?
  2. (Exercise) The ${theta_n}$'s are not continuous on $RR$, but you can choose a sequence ${tilde(theta_n)}$ to be continuous on $RR$ such that $tilde(theta_n) -> f$ a.e..
  3. Lusin's Theorem $=>$ $forall k$ sufficiently large, $exists A_k subset.eq A$ closed such that $m(A \\ A_k) <= 1/k$ and $f|_(A_k)$ continuous on $A_k$. In fact, we can construct them such that $A_k arrow.t$ (otherwise replace $A_k$ with $union.big_(i=1)^k A_i$).

  $ For any $A in cal(M)$, $bb(1)_A phi$ is again a simple function and we define $

  $

]

#proof[
1. wlog, we may assume $E_k$ and $F_ell$ are respectively disjoint. Set $a_0 = b_0 = 0$, $E_0 := (union.big_(k=1)^L E_k)^c, F_0 := (union.big_(ell=1)^M F_ell)^c$ for convenience. Now, ${E_0, dots, E_L}, {F_0, dots, F_M}$ are two partitions of $RR$. In particular, then, for each $k$, $bb(1)_E_k = sum_(ell=0)^M bb(1)_(E_k sect F_ell)$, since $E_k = union.big.sq_(ell=0)^M (E_k sect F_ell)$. Now, we have $
phi = sum_(k=0)^L a_k bb(1)_(E_k) = sum_(k=0)^L sum_(ell=0)^M a_k bb(1)_(E_k sect F_ell).
$ Similarly partitioning, we have $
phi = sum_(ell=0)^M b_ell bb(1)_(F_ell) =  sum_(ell=0)^M sum_(k=0)^L b_ell bb(1)_(E_k sect F_(ell)).
$ If $E_k sect F_ell eq.not nothing$, then $a_k = b_ell$, and thus on the one hand$
integral_RR phi =  sum_(k=0)^L sum_(ell=0)^M a_k m(E_k sect F_ell)
$ and on the other $
integral_RR phi =  sum_(ell=0)^M sum_(k=0)^L b_ell m(E_k sect F_(ell)),
$ (with summation convention $0 dot infinity = 0$). If $m(E_k sect F_ell) > 0$, then $E_k sect F_ell eq.not nothing$ and so $a_k = b_ell$ and so the two sums agree.
4. Assume $phi = sum_(k=1)^L a_k bb(1)_(E_k), psi = sum_(ell = 1)^M b_ell bb(1)_(F_ell)$. Repeat the partitioning/rewriting steps from part 1, then note that since $phi <= psi$, if $E_k sect F_ell eq.not nothing$, it must be that $a_k <= b_ell$, so if $m(E_k sect F_ell) > 0$ $a_k <= b_ell$ and thus the monotonicity follows.

=== Integral of Non-Negative Functions

#definition[
  If $f$ a non-negative, measurable function then the integral of $f$ is given by $
  integral_RR f(x) dif x = integral_RR f := sup{integral_RR phi :  phi "is simple and" phi <= f}.
  $
]

#proposition[The definition above agrees with that for simple functions that are also non-negative, namely this definition is consistent with the previous.]

#proof[
  Let $phi$ be non-negative. Then $phi <= phi$ certainly so the first definition $integral_RR phi <= sup {dots.c}$. Conversely, it suffices to show that for any non-negative simple $psi <= phi$, $integral_RR psi <= integral_RR phi$, using the first definition. But this simply follows from monotonicity of $integral$, and we are done.
]

#remark[
  Given $f >= 0$ and measurable, this definition implies that there exists a sequence ${phi_n}$ of simple functions such that $phi_n <= f$ and $lim_(n-> infinity) integral_RR phi_n = integral_RR f$. We would like to show that, in some sense, the choice of ${phi_n}$ is arbitrary.
]

#theorem[Suppose $f >= 0$ and measurable. If ${phi_n}$ a sequence of simple functions such that $phi_n arrow.t$ and $lim_(n->infinity) phi_n = f$ pointwise, then $
lim_(n->infinity) integral_RR phi_n = integral_RR f.
$]

#proof[
  Since $phi_n <= f$ for all $n >= 1$, then $integral_RR phi_n <= integral_RR f$ and so $lim_(n->infinity) integral_RR phi_n <= integral_RR f$ (nothing the limit on the LHS necessarily always exists by monotonicity). On the other hand, it suffices to show that $forall psi <= f$ simple, that $integral_RR psi <= lim_(n->infinity) integral_RR phi_n$. Assume $psi = sum_(k=1)^L a_k bb(1)_(E_k) = sum_(k=0)^L a_k bb(1)_(E_k)$ where ${E_0, dots, E_L}$ forms a partition of $RR$. Since $
  integral_RR psi = sum_(k=0)^L a_k m(E_k)
  $ and $
  integral_RR phi_n = sum_(k=0)^L integral_(E_k) phi_n
  $ by finite additivity. It suffices to show then that for each $k = 0, dots, L$, $a_k m(E_k) <= lim_(n->infinity) integral_E_k phi_n$.

  First, if $a_k = 0$ or $m(E_k) = 0$, then we are done. Assume $a_k, m(E_k) > 0$. For each fixed $k$, $lim_(n->infinity) phi_n = f >= psi$ so for every $x in E_k$, $lim_(n -> infinity) phi_n (x) >= psi(x) = a_k$. For any $epsilon > 0$, put $
  C_n^epsilon := {x in E_k : phi_n (x) >= (1 - epsilon) a_k}.
  $ Since $phi_n <= phi_(n+1)$, $C_n^epsilon arrow.t$ wrt $n$. Then note $
  union.big_(n=1)^infinity C_n^epsilon = E_k.
  $ Then, $
  lim_(n->infinity) integral_E_k phi_n = lim_(n->infinity) integral_RR bb(1)_(E_k) phi_n >= lim_(n->infinity) integral_RR bb(1)_(C_n^epsilon) phi_n >= lim_(n->infinity) (1- epsilon) a_k m(C_n^epsilon) = (1 - epsilon)a_k m(E_k), 
  $ where we use the fact that $bb(1)_(E_k)phi_n >= bb(1)_(C_n^epsilon) phi_n >= ( 1- epsilon) a_k bb(1)_(C_k^epsilon)$ and $lim_(n->infinity) m(C_n^epsilon) = m(union.big_(n=1)^infinity C_n^epsilon) = m(E_k)$. Since $epsilon$ arbitrary, then $
  lim_(n->infinity) integral_E_k phi_n >= a_k m(E_k),
  $ and we are done.

integral_RR g = lim_n integral_RR h_n &= lim_n (integral_{f = g} phi_n + integral_{f eq.not g} psi_n)= lim_n integral_{f = g} phi_n.

3. wlog, assume that $f <= g$ everywhere by replacing $f$ with $f bb(1)_{f <= g}$. Then, ${phi : "simple", phi <= f} subset.eq {phi : "simple", phi <= g}$ and so $integral_RR f <= integral_RR g$.
4.
  i. $impliedby$ clear. Conversely, we would like to prove that if $A = {f > 0}, m(A) = 0$. Put $A_n := {f >= 1/n}$ for $n >= 1$. Then, $A_n arrow.t$ and $union.big_(n=1)^infinity A_n = A$. By continuity of $m$, $
m(A) = lim_n m(A_n).
$ Suppose towards a contradiction that $m(A) = delta > 0$. Then, $delta = lim_n m(A_n)$, and so must exist $N >= 1$ such that $m(A_N) >= delta/2$. Since $f >= f bb(1)_(A_N) >= 1/N bb(1)_(A_N)$. By monotonicity, $integral_RR f >= integral_RR 1/N bb(1)_(A_N) = 1/N m(A_N) >= 1/N delta/2 > 0$, a contradiction.\
  ii. By i., $integral_A f = 0 <=> bb(1)_A f equiv 0$ a.e. on $RR$. If $m(A) = 0$, then $bb(1)_A equiv 0$ a.e. so $bb(1)_A f equiv 0$ a.e.. Else, if $m(A) > 0$, then $f equiv 0$ a.e. on $A$.\
  iii. Put $A := {f = infinity}$. Assume towards a contradiction that $m(A) = delta > 0$. Then, for every $n >= 1$, $f >= f bb(1)_A >= n bb(1)_A$ and so $integral_RR f >= integral_RR n bb(1)_A = n m(A) = n delta$. But this holds for any arbitrary $n$, so $integral_RR f = infinity$, a contradiction.
  5. Put $A_a := {f > a}$. Then $f >= f bb(1)_A_a > a bb(1)_A_a$ so $integral_RR f >= a m(A_a)$.

=== Integral of General Measurable, Integrable Functions

#definition[For $f$ measurable, $integral_RR f := integral_RR f^+ - integral_RR f^-$, provided that at least one of $integral_RR f^+$, $integral_RR f^-$ is finite; in particular, $integral_RR f$ may be finite or infinite.]

#remark[Only having $integral_RR f$ being defined is not sufficient for the desirable properties (linearity, monotonicity) to hold.]

#definition("Integrable")[A measurable function $f$ is called _integrable_, denoted $f in L^1 (RR)$, if _both_ $integral_RR f^+ < infinity$ and $integral_RR f^- < infinity$. Note that $
f in L^1 (RR) &<=> integral_RR |f| < infinity "(since" integral_RR |f| = integral_RR f^+ + integral_RR f^-")"\
&<=> integral_RR f "finite valued".
$]

#proposition("Properties of Integrals of Integrable Functions")[
1. $|integral_RR f| <= integral_RR |f|$
2. $f in L^1 (RR) => f$ is finite valued a.e.
3. (Linearity) For $f, g in L^1 (RR)$ and $a, b in RR$, $a f + b g in L^1 (RR)$ and $integral_RR (a f + b g) = a integral_RR f + b integral_RR g$
4. If $f in L^1 (RR)$ and $A in cal(M)$ and $m(A) = 0$ then $integral_A f = 0$; in particular if $f, g in L^1(RR)$ with $f = g$ a.e. then $integral_RR f = integral_RR g$
5. (Monotonicity) If $f, g in L^1(RR)$ with $f <= g$ a.e., then $integral_RR f <= integral_RR g$
]

#proof[
  1. $- integral_RR f^- <= integral_RR f <= integral_RR f^+$ and $integral_RR f^(plus.minus) <= integral_RR |f|$.
  2. We know $integral_RR |f| < infinity$ so $|f| < infinity$ a.e. by properties of integrals of non-negative functions so $m({f = plus.minus infinity}) = 0$
  3. $|a f| <= |a| |f|$ so by monotonicity of non-negative functions, $integral_RR |a f| <= |a| integral_RR |f| < infinity$ so $a f$ in $L^1 (RR)$. Note then that $
  (a f)^+ = cases(a f^plus "if" a >= 0, - a f^- "if" a < 0), wide (a f)^minus = cases(a f^- "if" a >= 0, - a f^+ "if" a < 0)
  $ so $
  integral_RR a f &= integral_RR (a f)^+ - integral_RR (a f)^-\
  &= cases(
    integral_RR a f^+ - integral_RR a f^- "if" a >= 0\
    integral_RR (-a) f^- - integral_RR (-a) f^+ "if" a < 0
  )\
  &= cases(
    a (integral_RR f^+ - integral_RR f^-) "if" a >= 0\
    (-a) (integral_RR f^- - integral_RR f^+) "if" a < 0
  ) = a integral_RR f.
  $ By the same argument $b g in L^1 (RR)$ and $integral_RR (b g) = b integral_RR g$. wlog, $a = b = 1$. We want to show $f + g in L^1 (RR)$; clearly $|f + g| <= |f| + |g| < infinity$ so it must be $f + g in L^1 (RR)$. Set $h := f + g$ then $|h, f, g| < infinity$ a.e. and each of the integrals of $|h, f, g| < infinity$. Then, $h^+ - h^- = f^+ - f^- + g^+ - g^-$. Then $h^+ + f^- + g^- = f^+ + g^+ + h^-$, where now both sides are non-negative functions. By linearity of integrals of non-negative functions and since all terms finite a.e., $
  integral h^+ + integral f^- + integral  g^- &=integral  f^+ +integral  g^+ + integral  h^-\
  &=> integral h^+ - integral h^- = integral f^+ - integral f^- + integral g^+ - integral g^-\
  &=>  integral (f + g) = integral h = integral f + integral g.
  $
  4. $|integral_A f| <= integral_A |f| = 0$.
  5. Put $h = g - f$ (valid since $f, g in L^1 (RR)$) then $h >= 0$ a.e. Then $integral_RR h >= 0$ so by linearity $integral_RR (g - f) = integral_RR g - integral_RR f >= 0$.

== Convergence Theorems of Integral

#theorem("Monotone Covergence Theorem (MON)")[
Assume ${f_n}$, $f$ are non-negative, measurable functions. If $f_n arrow.t$ and $lim_(n->infinity) f_n = f$, then $
integral_RR f = lim_(n->infinity) integral_RR f_n.
$
]
#remark[
  When we write $lim_n f_n = f$, we mean pointwise convergence; however, one can replace these statements with convergence a.e. and obtain an equivalent, more general result wlog.
]
#proof[
  By monotonicity of non-negative functions, $lim_(n -> infinity) integral_RR f_n$ exists, forming an increasing sequence. Since $f_n <= f$, then we know too that $lim_(n-> infinity) integral_RR f_n <= integral_RR f$. 

  Conversely, for every $n$, let ${phi_(n, k)}_(k in NN)$ be a sequence of simple functions such that $phi_(n, k) arrow.t$ w.r.t $k$ and $phi_(n, k) -> f_n$ as $k -> infinity$;
  $
  f_1 & wide f_2 & wide dots.c & wide f_k & wide f_(k+1) & wide dots.c & wide -> f\
  dots.v & wide dots.v  & wide  dots.up & wide  dots.v & wide dots.v\
  phi_(1, k) & wide phi_(2, k) & wide dots.up & wide phi_(k,k) & wide phi_(k+1, k) & wide dots.c \
  dots.v & wide dots.v  & wide  dots.up & wide  dots.v & wide dots.v & wide dots.c \
  phi_(1, 2) & wide phi_(2, 2) & wide dots.up & wide phi_(k,2) & wide phi_(k+1, 2)& wide dots.c  \
  phi_(1, 1) & wide phi_(2, 1) & wide dots.c & wide phi_(k,1) & wide phi_(k+1, 1) & wide dots.c \
  
  $
   For each $k >= 1$, let $
  g_k := max{phi_(1,k), phi_(2,k), dots, phi_(k,k)}.
  $ Then, $g_k$ simple for each $k$, and $g_k arrow.t$ and $g_k <= f$. So, $lim_(k->infinity) g_k$ exists. Then, for all $n >= 1$, $lim_(k->infinity) g_k >= lim_(k->infinity) phi_(n, k) = f_n$ so $lim_(k->infinity) g_k >= lim_(n -> infinity) f_n = f$. Thus, $lim_(k -> infinity) integral_RR g_k = integral_RR f$ by a previous theorem. Since $forall k >= 1$, $phi_(1, k), phi_(2, k), dots.c, phi_(k, k) <= f_k$, $g_k <= f_k$ and thus by monotonicity $integral_RR g_k <= integral_RR f_k => integral_RR f =  lim_(k -> infinity) integral_RR g_k <= lim_(k->infinity) integral_RR f_k$ as desired.
]

#corollary[
  If ${f_n}, f$ measurable functions such that $f_n arrow.t$ and $lim_n f_n = f$ and $integral_RR f_1^- < infinity$, then $integral_RR f = lim_(n) integral_RR f_n$.
]
#proof[
Since $f_n arrow.t, f_n >= f_1$ so $f >= f_1$. Then, $f_n^- <= f_1^-, f^- <= f_1^-$, all of these are finite valued a.e., and $integral_RR f_n^- <= integral_RR f_1^- < infinity$ and $integral_RR f^- <= integral_RR f_1^- < infinity$. For each $n >= 1$, set $tilde(f_n) := f_n + f_1^- = f_n^+ - f_n^- + f_1^- >= 0$, and $tilde(f_n) arrow.t$ with $lim_(n) tilde(f_n) = f + f_1^- =: tilde(f) >= 0$. By MON, $integral_RR tilde(f) = lim_(n) integral_RR tilde(f_n)$ so $integral_RR (f + f_1^-) = lim_(n) integral_RR (f_n + f_1^-)$.

We have that $tilde(f_n) = f_n + f_1^- = f_n^+ - f_n^- + f_1^- => tilde(f_n)+ f_n^- = f_n^+ + f_1^-$, which is valid since $f_n^- < infinity$ a.e.. By linearity, then, $
integral_RR tilde(f_n) + integral_RR f_n^- &= integral_RR f_n^+ + integral_RR f_1^-\
&=> integral_RR tilde(f_n) = integral_RR f_n^+ - integral_RR f_n^- + integral_RR f_1^- wide "because" integral_RR f_n^- < infinity\
&=>integral_RR tilde(f_n) = integral_RR f_n + integral_RR f_1^-.
$ Similar work gives $integral_RR tilde(f) = integral_RR f + integral_RR f_1^-$, and taking limits and using $lim_n integral_RR (f_n + f_1^-) = integral_RR (f + f_1^-)$ completes the proof.

#theorem("Reverse MON")[

#theorem("Fatou's Lemma")[
  Assume ${f_n}$ non-negative, measurable. Then $
  integral_RR (liminf_(n->infinity) f_n) <= liminf_(n->infinity)( integral_RR f_n).

  For every $m >= 1$, set $g_m := inf_(n >= m) f_n$. Then, $g_m$ non-negative and $g_m arrow.t$, with $lim_(m) g_m = liminf_n f_n$. By MON, $integral_RR liminf_n f_n = lim_(m->infinity) (integral_RR g_m)$. For every $n >= m$ , $g_m <= f_n$, so by monotonicity, $integral_RR g_m <= integral_RR f_n$ for every $n >= m$, so $integral_RR g_m <= inf_(n >= m) integral_RR f_n$, and hence $lim_(m->infinity) integral_RR g_m <= lim_(m -> infinity) inf_(n>=m) integral_RR f_n = liminf_(n) (integral_RR f_n)$, and the proof follows.

  integral_RR (liminf_n f_n) <= liminf_n (integral_RR f_n).
  $
]

#proof[
  Since $f_n >= g$ for all $n >= 1$, $f_n^- <= g^-$ so $f_n^- < infinity$ a.e. and $integral_RR f_n^- < infinity$. Set $tilde(f_n) := f_n + g^- >= 0$. Then, apply Fatou to get $integral_RR liminf_n tilde(f_n) <= liminf_n integral_RR tilde(f_n)$, then it suffices to check linearity.

#proof[
  Apply previous proof to ${-f_n}$.

#remark[
  The "floor" $g$ is necessary. Let $f_n (x) := cases(-1 & "if" x>= n, 0 & "if" x < n)$. Then, $f_n arrow.t$, and $lim_n f_n = 0$ while $integral_RR f_n = -infinity$ for every $n$, so MON doesn't apply.

#theorem("Dominated Convergence Theorem (DOM)")[
Assume ${f_n}, f$ measurable with $lim_(n) f_n = f$. If there exists a $g in L^1 (RR)$ such that $|f_n| <= |g|$ for all $n$, then $f_n -> f$ in $L^1 (RR)$ i.e. $lim_(n->infinity) integral_RR |f_n - f| =0$. In particular, $integral_RR f = lim_n integral_RR f_n$.
]

#proof[
  Since $|f_n| <= |g|$ and $f = lim_(n->infinity) f_n$, then $|f| <= |g|$. So, $integral_RR |f_n| <= integral_RR |g| < infinity$ and similarly $integral_RR |f| <= integral_RR |g| < infinity$ so $|f_n|, f in L^1 (RR)$.

  Observe that $|f_n - f| <= 2 |g|$, and $integral_RR (2 |g|) < infinity$. Applying Reverse Fatou to ${|f_n - f|}_(n in NN)$, we find $
  integral_RR (underbrace(limsup_n (|f_n - f|), 0)) &>= limsup_n (integral_RR |f_n - f|)\
  &=>  lim_(n -> infinity) integral_RR |f_n - f|= 0,
  $ so in particular $
  |integral_RR f_n - integral_RR f| = |integral_RR (f_n - f)| <= integral_RR |f_n - f| -> 0
  $ so $lim_(n) integral_RR f_n = integral_RR f$.

#remark[
  We must find $g in L^1 (RR)$ to dominate $|g| >= |f_n|$ irrespective of $n$. For instance, if $f_n = bb(1)_[n,2n]$, then $lim_(n) f_n = 0$, but $integral_RR f_n = n$ for all $n >= 1$. DOM doesn't apply, since we would need a constant $1$ function to dominate all $f_n$, which is not integrable.

== Riemann Integral vs Lebesgue Integral

Recall; let $f$ be bounded on $[a, b]$. Then, $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$ if $
cases(f "is continuous on" [a, b], f "is monotonic on" [a, b], f "is continuous except at possibly finitely many points in" [a, b]).
$

Recall the function $f = bb(1)_(QQ sect [0, 1])$. $f$ is not Riemann integrable, but is Lebesgue integrable, because $|f| <= bb(1)_[0, 1] in L^1 (RR)$.

#remark[
  1. $exists$ bounded functions on $[a, b]$ that are not Riemann integrable.
  2. In general, $g$ being Riemann integrable and $|f| <= |g| arrow.double.r.not f$ is Riemann integrable ($bb(1)_(QQ sect [0, 1]) <= bb(1)_[0,1]$).
  3. In general, DOM and MON do _not_ apply to Riemann integrable. For instance, consider ${q_n}$ an enumeration of $QQ sect [0, 1]$. Define $f_n (x) := cases(1 &"if" x in {q_1, dots, q_n}, 0 &"else")$. $f_n arrow.t$, with $f_n -> bb(1)_(QQ sect [0, 1])$. So, MON applies with the Lebesgue integral, but $f_n$ is only discontinuous, for every $n$, at finitely many points, so $f_n$ Riemann integrable with $integral_0^1^((R)) f_n = 0$, but the limit is not Riemann integrable.

#proof[
  $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$, so there is some $M > 0$ such that $|f| <= M$ on $[a, b]$. Further, there exist step functions $phi_n, psi_n$ with $phi_n <= f <= psi_n$ on $[a, b]$ and $|phi_n|, |psi_n| <= M$ for all $n >= 1$, and $

  $ Denote $phi := lim_(n->infinity) phi_n, psi:= lim_(n->infinity) psi_n$, which exist by Monotonicity. Since $phi_n, psi_n$ are step functions, they are measurable hence $phi, psi$ measurable with $phi <= f <= psi$. Observe that the Lebesgue, Riemann integral coincide on step functions. Hence, $integral_a^b^((R)) phi_n = integral_[a, b] phi_n$, same with $psi_n$. By DOM, (with $M$ as the dominator) $
  integral_[a, b] phi = lim_n integral_[a, b] phi_n  = lim_n integral_a^b^((R)) phi_n = integral_a^b^((R)) (f) = lim_n integral_a^b^((R)) psi_n = lim_n integral_[a, b] psi_n = integral_[a, b] psi.
  $ Since $phi <= psi$ and $integral_[a, b] (psi - phi) = 0$, we have that $psi = phi$ a.e. on $[a, b]$ by properties of integrals of non-negative functions, and thus $f = phi = psi$ a.e. on $[a, b]$. In particular, then, $f$ is measurable, being equal a.e. to measurable functions. Thus, since $|f| <= M$ on $[a, b]$, $f in L^1 ([a, b])$, and so since integrals agree on functions that are equal a.e.,  $integral_[a, b]  f = integral_[a, b] phi = integral_a^b^((R)) f$ as desired.

#example[
  We return to our example of computing $lim_(n->infinity) integral_([0, infinity)) n/(1+n^2 x^2) dif x$. We may rewrite $
  integral_([0, infinity)) n/(1+n^2 x^2) dif x = integral_([0, T]) n/(1+n^2 x^2) dif x + integral_([T, infinity)) n/(1+n^2 x^2) dif x
  $ where $T > 0$. We know from the previous example that the RHS integral converges to 0 by application of DOM. Now, $n/(1+n^2 x^2)$ is continuous on $[0, T]$ and thus Riemann integrable, and so by the previous theorem $
  integral_([0, T]) n/(1+n^2 x^2) = integral_([0, T])^((R)) n/(1+n^2 x^2) = arctan(n T).
  $ As $n -> infinity$, $arctan(n T) -> pi/2$, and thus the limit of the whole integral indeed exists, and is in fact equal to $pi/2$.

#proof[
  We will employ "Young's Inequality", which states that for all $a, b >= 0$, $a b <= (a^p)/p + (b^q)/q$ where $1/p + 1/q = 1$. Since $f in L^p, g in L^q$,  set $tilde(f) := f/(||f||_p)$ and $tilde(g) := g/(||g||_q)$. Then, a.e. $
  |tilde(f) tilde(g)| <= (|tilde(f)|^p)/p + (|tilde(g)|^q)/q.
  $ We have $
  integral_RR |tilde(f) tilde(g)| = integral_RR (|f g|)/(||f||_p ||g||_q)

  integral_RR  (|tilde(f)|^p)/p + (|tilde(g)|^q)/q = 1/p (integral_(RR) |f|^p)/(||f||_p^p) + 1/q (integral_(RR) |g|^q)/(||g||_q^q) = 1/p + 1/q = 1,

  |G - G_m| <= sum_(k=m+1)^infinity |g_k|.
  $ Fix $epsilon > 0$. Since $sum_(k=1)^infinity ||g_k||_p < infinity$, exists some $M >= 1$ such that $sum_(k=M+1)^infinity ||g_k||_p < epsilon$. Then, $
  integral_RR |G - G_M|^p <= integral_RR (sum_(k=M+1)^infinity |g_k|)^p &= lim_(L -> infinity) integral_RR (sum_(k=M+1)^L |g_k|)^p\

#theorem[Let $1 <= p < infinity$. Then $L^p (RR)$ is a complete normed space under the $p$-norm.]

#proof[
  Let $f_n in L^p (RR)$ be a Cauchy sequence under $||dot||_p$. We can choose a subsequence ${n_k}$ such that for every $k >= 1$, $||f_n_(k+1) - f_(n_k)||_p <= 2^(-k)$. Set $g_k := f_(n_(k+1)) - f_(n_k)$. By the lemma, if $G_m := sum_(k=1)^m g_k$, there exists some $G in L^p (RR)$ such that $G_m -> G$ a.e. and in $L^p (RR)$. In fact, we have $
  G_m = sum_(k=1)^m g_k = sum_(k=1)^m (f_(n_(k + 1)) - f_n_k) = f_(n_(m+1)) - f_n_1,
  $ hence $
  G = lim_(m->infinity) G_m = (lim_(m->infinity) f_(n_(m+1))) - f_n_1.
  $ Let $f := G + f_n_1$. Then, $f = lim_(m->infinity) f_(n_m)$ a.e. and since $G_m -> G$ in $L^p$, we have that $f_n_m -> f$ in $L^p$ as $m -> infinity$. It remains to show convergence in $L^p$ along the whole subsequence.

  Fix $epsilon > 0$. Let $N >= 1$ such that $sup_(k, ell >= N) ||f_k - f_ell||_p < epsilon$ and $m$ sufficiently large such that $n_m > N$ and $||f_(n_m) - f||_p <= epsilon$. Then, $
  ||f_n - f||_p <= underbrace(||f_n - f_(n_m)||_p, < epsilon) + underbrace(||f_n_m - f||_p, < epsilon)<2 epsilon,

  integral_RR |f_n - f|^p <= integral_(RR \\ [-n,n]) |f|^p + integral_({|f| > n}) |f|^p -> 0 "as" n-> infinity.  
  $

#lemma[
Simple functions are dense in $L^p (RR)$.

#proof[
  For $f in L^p (RR)$, let $f_n$ be as in the previous proof. For each $n >= 1, k = 0, 1, dots, n 2^n - 1$, set $

  B_(n, k) := {x in [-n, n] : k/(2^n) <= f_n^- < (k+1)/2^n}, wide phi_(n)^- :=  sum_(k=0)^(n 2^n - 1) k/2^n bb(1)_(B_(n,k)).
  $ Put $phi_n := phi_n^+ - phi_n^-$. This is a simple function, and $|phi_n| <= n$ and supported on $[-n, n]$ for every $n$ hence $phi_n in L^p (RR)$. In addition, $lim_n phi_n (x) = f(x)$. In particular, for any $n >= 1$, $
  |f_n (x) - phi_n (x)| <= |f_n^+ (x) - phi_n^+ (x)| + |f_n^(-) (x) - phi_n^- (x)| <= 2 dot 2^(-n).
  $ Then, in particular $
  ||f - phi_n||_p <= underbrace(||f - f_n||_p, -> 0) + underbrace(||f_n - phi_n||_p, =(integral_([-n,n]) |f_n - phi_n|^p)^(1/p) \ <= (( 2 dot 2^(-n))^p m([-n,n]))^(1/p) -> 0),

#theorem[Let $C_c (RR)$ denote the space of continuous and compactly supported functions. Then, $C_c (RR)$ is dense in $L^p (RR)$ for $1 <= p < infinity$.]

#proof[
  Give $f in L^p (RR)$, let ${phi_n}$ simple functions as in the previous proof. Recall that, for every $n >= 1$, there exists a step function $theta_n$ such that $theta_n <= sup_x |phi_n (x)| <= n$, is supported on $[-n - 1, n+1]$, _and_ ${theta_n eq.not phi_n}$ has arbitrarily small measure. In particular, we choose $theta_n$ such that $m({theta_n eq.not phi_n}) <= 2^(-n - 1)$ for every $n >= 1$.

  Recall that given a step function $theta_n$, there exists a function $tilde(theta_n)$ continuous on $RR$, $tilde(theta_n)$ is supported on $[-n - 2, n + 2]$, _and_ $m({tilde(theta_n) - theta_n}) <= 2^(-n-1)$. Thus, ${tilde(theta_n)} subset.eq C_c (RR)$, and $
  m({tilde(theta_n) - phi_n}) <= m ({tilde(theta_n) eq.not theta_n}) + m({theta_n eq.not phi_n}) <= 2^(-n).
  $ So, we have $
  ||f - tilde(theta_n)||_p <= underbrace(||f - phi_n||_p, -> 0 "by lemma") + underbrace(||phi_n - tilde(theta_n)||_p, = (integral_RR |phi_n - tilde(theta_n)|^p)^(1/p) \ = (integral_{tilde(theta_n) eq.not phi_n}|phi_n - tilde(theta_n)|^p)^(1/p)\
   <= ((2n)^p 2^(-n))^(1/p) -> 0),
  $ and thus $tilde(theta_n) -> f$ in $L^p (RR)$.

#remark[
  The density of $C_c (RR)$ in $L^p (RR)$ is useful in the study of properties of generic $L^p$ functions. For instance, show that if $f in L^p (RR)$, then $lim_(n -> infinity) integral_RR |f(x+1/n) - f(x)|^p dif x = 0$, that is $f(dot + 1/n) -> f$ in $L^p (RR)$ using this density.

  For $delta > 0$, we have $
  m({|f_n - f| > delta}) = integral_{|f_n - f| > delta} 1 dif x.
  $ Remark that $1 <= (|f_n - f|)/delta$ over ${|f_n - f| > delta}$; further $1^p = 1 <= ((|f_n - f|)/delta)^p$. Hence, $
   <= integral_({|f_n - f| > delta}) (|f_n - f|^p)/(delta^p) dif x <= 1/delta^p integral_RR |f_n - f|^p <= 1/(delta^p) ||f_n - f||^p_p.

  == Preparations
  Given a measure space $(X, cal(F), mu)$ with $mu$ a $sigma$-finite measure (i.e. there exists a sequence ${X_n} subset.eq cal(F)$ such that $X_n arrow.t$ and $union.big_n X_n = X$, and $mu(X_n) < infinity$ for each $n$).

  #definition("Measurable")[$f : X -> overline(R)$ is $cal(F)$-measurable if $forall a in RR$, $f^(-1)([-infinity, a)) in cal(F)$.]

  We have similar properties for $f$ in general as in the Lebesgue setting.
  -For $f$ $cal(F)$-measurable, $c f, f^k, |f|, f and a, f or b, f^+, f^-$ are all $cal(F)$-measurable for $a, b, c in RR$.
  - For $f, g$ $cal(F)$-measurable, $f + g, f - g, f dot g, f and g, f or g$ are all $cal(F)$-measurable.
  - If ${f_n}$ $cal(F)$-measurable, $sup_n f_n, inf_n f_n, limsup_n f_n, liminf_n f_n$ are $cal(F)$-measurable.

  We may "dissect" functions as before. For $f$ $cal(F)$-measurable, write $f = f^+ - f^-$, and put for $n >= 1$ and $bullet = +, -$, $
  f_n^bullet := bb(1)_(X_n) (f^bullet and n). 
  $ Then, $f_n^bullet arrow.t f^bullet$. Put $
  phi^bullet_n := sum_(k=0)^(n 2^n) k/2^n bb(1)_(A_(n,k)^bullet),
  $ where, for $k = 0,1, dots, n 2^n$ for $n >= 1$, $
  A_(n, k)^bullet = {x in X_n : k/2^n <= f_n^bullet < (k+1)/2^n} in cal(F).
  $ Then, we may define the integral of the simple function $
  integral_X phi_n^bullet dif mu := sum_(k=0)^(n 2^n) k/2^n mu(A_(n,k)^bullet).
  $ Define then $
  integral_X f^(bullet) dif mu := lim_n integral_X phi_n^bullet dif mu,
  $ and $
    integral_X f dif mu := integral_X f^+ dif mu - integral_X f^- dif mu.
  $ We say, then, $f in L^1 (mu)$ if $integral_X |f| dif mu < infinity$. This generalizes the notion of integration to a (slightly more) general $sigma$-algebra.

  cal(M)^2 := sigma({A times B : A, B in cal(M)}),
  $ where $
  A times B := {(x, y) : x in A, y in B}
  $ as is standard.
]

Notice $cal(M)^2$ contains 
- rectangles $I_1 times I_2$, $I_1, I_2$ intervals;
- singletons ${(x, y)}$;
- open sets, closed sets, and so $frak(B)(RR^2) := sigma({"open sets in" RR^2}) subset.eq cal(M)^2$.

Given $G$ open, then for every $x in G$, there exists some disc centered at $x$ contained entirely in $G$. Moreover, there exist $(a_1, a_2), (b_1, b_2)$ with $a_i, b_i in QQ$ such that $x in (a_1, a_2) times (b_1, b_2) subset G$. Then, $G = union.big_(x in G)(a_1, a_2) times (b_1, b_2).

#definition("Slice")[Given $E subset.eq RR^2$, then for every $x in R$, define $
E_x := {y in RR : (x, y) in E} subset.eq RR,
$ called the _slice_ of $E$ at $x$. Similarly, define for $y in RR$, $
E^y := {x in RR : (x, y) in E} subset.eq RR.
$]

#proposition[
  If $E in cal(M)^2$, then for every $x in RR$, $E_x in cal(M)$, and for every $y in RR$ $E^y in cal(M)$; that is, product measurability $=>$ marginal measurability.
]

#proof[
  Define $
  cal(A) := {E subset.eq RR^2 : forall x in RR, E_x in cal(M)}.
  $ We claim $cal(A)$ a $sigma$-algebra of subsets of $RR^2$.

  - $RR^2 in cal(A)$? Yes, since for every $x in RR$, $RR^2_x = RR in cal(M)$.
  - Let $E in cal(A)$. Then, $E_x in cal(M)$ for every $x in RR$. But we have too $
  (E^c)_x = (E_x)^c,
  $ and since $E_x in cal(M) => (E_x)^c in cal(M)$, it follows that $E^c in cal(A)$.
  - If ${E_n} subset.eq cal(A)$, then for every $x in RR$, $
  (union.big_(n) E_n)_x = (union.big_(n) (E_n)_x) in cal(M)
  $ so $union.big_(n) E_n in cal(A)$.

  Hence, $cal(A)$ indeed a $sigma$-algebra of subsets of $RR^2$. For every $A, B in cal(M)$, we claim $A times B in cal(A)$. We have that for every $x in RR$, $
  (A times B)_x = cases(
    nothing & "if" x in.not A, B & "if" x in A
  ) in cal(M),
  $ hence $A times B in cal(A)$. Thus, since such sets generate $cal(M)^2$, it follows that $cal(M)^2 subset.eq cal(A)$, and so every set in $cal(M)^2$ has the desired property.

  An identical proof follows for $E^y$-type slices.
]

#remark[Notice we didn't prove $cal(A) = cal(M)^2$, indeed, because its not true.

For instance, let $E = N times A$ with $N$ the Vitali set and $A in cal(M)$. Then, for every $x in A$, $E_x = cases(A & "if" x in N, nothing & "if" x in.not N) in cal(M)$, but $E in.not cal(M)^2$, because for every $y in RR$, $E^y = cases(N &"if" y in A, nothing "else")$.

In fact, there eixsts sets such that $E_x$ and $E^y in cal(M)$ for every $x, y in RR$, but $E in.not cal(M)^2$ (the _Sierpinski set_).

However, if $E subset.eq RR^2$ a product set, i.e. $E = A times B$ for some $A, B subset.eq RR$, then $A, B in cal(M) => E in cal(M)^2$.

#definition("Slice of sets")[Let $f : RR^2 -> overline(RR)$ a function. For every $x in RR$, define $
f_x : RR -> overline(RR), wide f_x (y) := f(x, y),

#example[If $f = bb(1)_E$ for some $E subset.eq RR^2$, then $f_x = bb(1)_(E_x)$.]

#proposition[
If $f : RR^2 -> overline(R)$ is $cal(M)^2$-measurable, then for every $x in RR$, $f_x$ is $cal(M)$-measurable, and for every $y in RR$ $f^y$ is $cal(M)$-measurable.
]

#proof[
  Observe that for every $B subset.eq RR$, $
  (f^(-1)(B))_x = f_x^(-1) (B)
  $ for every $x in RR$, with similar for $thin^y$. In particular, then, if $f$ $cal(M)^2$-measurable, then for every $a in RR$, $f^(-1) ([-infinity, a)) in cal(M)^2$ hence $f_x^(-1) ([-infinity, a)) = (f^(-1) ([-infinity, a))_x in cal(M)$, with the same idea following for $thin^y$.
  // $epsilon -> 0$
]

#remark[
  - If $f : RR^2 -> R$ is continuous, then $f$ is measurable. For every $a in RR$, $f^(-1) ((-infinity, a))$ open by virtue (indeed, definition) of continuity, hence in $cal(M)^2$.
  - If $f = bb(1)_E$ for some $E subset.eq RR^2$, $f$ $cal(M)^2$-measurable $<=>$ $E in cal(M)^2$.
  - In general, there exists $f : RR^2 -> overline(R)$ such that $f_x$ $cal(M)$-measurable but $f$ is not $cal(M)^2$-measurable.
  - If $f(x, y) = h(x) g(y)$ for some non-trivial $h, g : RR -> overline(RR)$, then $f$ is $cal(M)^2$-measurable $<=>$ both $h$ and $g$ are $cal(M)$-measurable. We show $impliedby$; $

  &= {(x, y) : h(x)= 0, 0 < a} \
  & wide union {(x, y) : h(x) > 0, g(y) < a/(h(x))} \

  $ and $
  I_E^((2)) : RR -> overline(RR), wide I_E^((2))(y) := m(E^y).

#theorem[
  Given $E in cal(M)^2$, $I_E^((1)), I_E^((2))$ are $cal(M)$-measurable functions, and in particular $
  integral_RR I_E^((1)) (x) dif x = integral_RR I^((2))_E (y) dif y. wide ast.circle
  $
]

#proof[
  If indeed $I_E^((1)), I_E^((2))$ $cal(M)$-measurable, then the integrals of the functions are well-defined, being non-negative functions.

  Set $
  Sigma := {E in cal(M)^2 : I_(E_N)^((1)), I_(E_N)^((2)) "are" cal(M)"-measurable and "  ast.circle "holds", "for" E_N := E sect [-N, N]^2 "for all " N > 0}.
  $
  Note that for every $E in cal(M)^2$, for all $N > 0$, $
  I_(E_N)^((1)) (x) &= cases(m((E_N)_x) & "if" x in [-N, N], 
  0 & "o.w."
  ) = bb(1)_[-N, N] (x) I_(E_N)^((1)) (x).
  $ similarly for $I_(E_N)^((2))$.

  Let $cal(C) := {A times B : A, B in cal(M)}$ (recall $cal(M)^2 = sigma (cal(C))$).

  - _Claim 1:_ $cal(C) subset.eq Sigma$

  For every $N > 0$, $E_N = (A times B) sect [-N, N]^2 = A_N times B_N$ ($A_N := A sect [-N, N]$). Then, $
  I_(E_N)^((1)) (x) = I_(A_N times B_N)^((1)) (x) = cases(
     m(B_N) & "if"  x in A_N,
     0 & "if" x in.not A_N
  ), wide I_(E_N)^((2)) (y) = I_(A_N times B_N)^((2)) (y) = cases(
     m(A_N) & "if"  y in B_N,
     0 & "if" y in.not B_N
  ),
  $ and so $I_(E_N)^((1)), I_(E_N)^((2))$ are measurable seeing as they are both just indicator functions of measurable sets times a constant. In particular, $
  integral_RR I_(E_N)^((1)) = m(B_N)m(A_N) = integral_RR I_(E_N)^((2)),
  $ as required. Hence, indeed $E_N in Sigma$ and so $cal(C) subset.eq Sigma$.


  - _Claim 2:_ $RR^2 in Sigma$

  For every $N > 0$, $
  I_([-N,N]^2)^((1)) (x) = cases(
2N & "if" x in [-N, N],
0 & "o.w."
  ), 
  $ similar for $I^((2))_[-N,N]^2$. $I_[-N,N]^2^((1)), I_[-N,N]^((2))$ are both $cal(M)$-measurable, and their integrals agree, and so it follows that $R^2 in Sigma$.

  - _Claim 3:_ $E in Sigma => E^c in Sigma$

  For each $N > 0$, denote $
  F_N := E^c sect[-N,N]^2.
  $ $I_(F_N)^((1)) = 0$ outside of $[-N, N]$, and for $x in [-N,N]$, $
  (F_N)_x = {y : (x, y) in E^c sect [-N,N]^2} = [-N,N]\\E_x = [-N, N] \\ (E_N)_x
  $ so $
  I_(F_N)^((1)) (x) = 2 N - I_(E_N)^((1)) (x)
  $ for $x in [-N, N]$. Similarly, $
  I_(F_N)^((2)) (y) = cases(
    2N-I_(E_N)^((2)) (y) & "if" y in [-N,N],
    0 & "o.w."
  ).
  $ In particular, then, $I_(F_N)^((1)), I_(F_N)^((2))$ measurable, and $
  integral_RR I_(F_N)^((1)) = integral_[-N,N] 2N - I_(E_N)^((1)) = 4N^2 - integral_RR I_(E_N)^((1)) \ 
  integral_RR I_(F_N)^((2)) = integral_[-N,N] 2N - I_(E_N)^((2)) = 4N^2 - integral_RR I_(E_N)^((2)),
  $ but we know $integral_RR I_(E_N)^((1)) = integral_RR I_(E_N)^((2))$ since $E_N in Sigma$, hence it follows that $integral_RR F_N^((1)) = integral_RR F_N^((2))$ and so it follows that $E^c in Sigma$.

  - _Claim 4:_ ${E_k} subset.eq Sigma => E:=union.big_(k=1)^infinity E_k in Sigma$.

  Wlog, $E_n$'s disjoint. For $N > 0$, $E_N = union.big_(k=1)^infinity E_(k,N)$.
  $
  I_(E_N)^((1)) (x) = bb(1)_[-N,N] (x) m(union.big_(k=1)^infinity (E_(k, N))_x) = bb(1)_[-N,N] sum_(k=1)^infinity m((E_(k,N))_x) = sum_(k=1)^infinity I^((1))_(E_(k,N)) (x),
  $ with similarly $I_(E_N)^((2))(y) = sum_(k=1)^infinity I_(E_(k,N))^((2)) (y)$. This implies $I_(E_N)^((1)), I_(E_N)^((2))$ are $cal(M)$-measurable, and in particular $
  integral_RR I^((1))_(E_N) = sum_(k=1)^infinity integral_RR I_(E_(k,N))^((1)), wide  integral_RR I^((2))_(E_N) = sum_(k=1)^infinity integral_RR I_(E_(k,N))^((2)),
  $ which are equal since by assumption $E_(k) in Sigma$. Hence, $E in Sigma$, and thus by Claims 2-4, $Sigma$ a $sigma$-algebra of subsets of $RR^2$, and thus by Claim 1 $Sigma = cal(M)^2$.

  Hence, for every $E in cal(M)^2$, $E in Sigma$ and so all the statements hold for $E_N$ for every $N > 0$. Then, $
  I_(E)^((1)) (x) = lim_(N->infinity) bb(1)_[-N, N] (x) m((E_N)_x) = lim_(N->infinity) m((E_N)_x) = m(E_x) = lim_(N->infinity) I_(E_N)^((1)) (x),
  $ and in particular ${I_(E_N)^((1))} arrow.t$, hence $I_(E)^((1))$ $cal(M)$-measurable, and $
  integral_RR I_E^((1)) = lim_(N->infinity) integral_RR I_(E_N)^((1)),
  $ with similar for $I_E^((2))$, by monotonicity. Thus, since $integral_RR I_(E_N)^((1)) = integral_RR I_(E_N)^((2))$ for every $N$, the proof follows.

m(E) := integral_RR I_E^((1)) (x) dif x = integral_RR I_E^((2)) (x) dif x, wide E in cal(M)^2.
$ $m$ is called the _Lebesgue measure on $RR^2$_.
]

#proposition[
  $m$ is indeed a measure on $(RR^2, cal(M)^2)$.
]

#proof[
  - $m(nothing) = integral_RR 0 = 0$
  - If ${E_k} subset.eq cal(M)^2$ disjoint, let $E = union.big_(k=1)^infinity E_k$. Then $
  m(E) = sum_(k=1)^infinity m(E_k), 
  $ since for every $x in RR$, $E_x = union.big_(k=1)^infinity (E_k)_x$ disjoint, so $
  integral_RR I_E^((1)) = sum_(k=1)^infinity integral_RR I_(E_k)^((1)),
  $ and the proof follows.
]

#remark[
  1. For any $E = I_1 times I_2$, $m(E) = ell(I_1) dot ell(I_2)$. It follows that any singleton, and countable set, and any line on $RR^2$ is a null set.
  2. If $A subset.eq RR$ is a null set in $cal(M)$, then $A times RR, RR times A$ are null sets, in $cal(M)^2$.
  3. $cal(M)^2$ is _not_ complete under $m$, since for instance if $N subset RR$ the Vitali set, $a in RR$, then ${a} times N subset.eq {a} times RR$ is a subset of a null set, but ${a} times N$ is not measurable.
  4. It is possible to construct $m$ on $RR^2$ through the "outer measure" approach. We take $E subset.eq RR^2$, and define $
  m^ast (E) = inf {sum_(n=1)^infinity "Area"(R_n) : R_n"'s closed, finite rectangles s.t." E subset.eq union.big_(n=1)^infinity R_n}.
  $ Then, $m^ast$ satisfies similar properties as the 1-dimensional analog. We then say a set $E$ is measurable if for every $F subset.eq RR^2$, $m^ast (F) = m^ast (F sect E) + m^ast (F sect E^c)$. Collect all such sets, $overline(cal(M)^2) := {E subset.eq RR^2 : E "measurable"}$. This is a $sigma$-algebra of subsets of $RR^2$, with $m := m^ast|_(overline(cal(M)^2))$ a measure when restricted to it. Indeed, $m$ matches the Lebesgue measure defined above, and $overline(cal(M)^2)$, as suggestively notated, the completion of $cal(M)^2$ under the Lebesgue measure. In addition, $overline(cal(M)^2) = overline(frak(B)_(RR^2))$.
  + The Lebesgue measure $m$ on $RR^2$ is the unique measure on $cal(M)^2\/frak(B)_(RR^2)\/overline(cal(M)^2)$ such that for all $I_1 times I_2$ rectangles, $m(I_1 times I_2) = ell(I_1) ell(I_2)$. This is because $cal(I) := {I_1 times I_2 : I_1, I_2 "finite intervals"}$ is a $pi$-system and generates $frak(B)_(RR^2)$.
  + The Lebesgue measure on $RR^2$ is translation invariant (rectangle area is invariant under translation). Namely, show that $m_Z : cal(M)^2 -> [0, infinity]$, $m_z (E) := m(E + z)$ is a measure and $m_z = m$ on $cal(I)$.
  + The Lebesgue measure $m$ on $RR^2$ is the only measure on $cal(M)^2 \/ frak(B)_(RR^2)\/ overline(cal(M)^2)$ that is translation invariant, assigns finite values to compact sets, and assigns $1$ to $[0, 1] times [0, 1]$.

#proof[
  Since $f$ $cal(M)^2$-measurable, non-negative, there exists ${phi_n}$-sequence of simple functions with $phi_n arrow.t f$, and $integral_(RR^2) f = lim_n integral_(RR^2 )phi_n$, where, eg $
  phi_n = sum_(k=0)^(n 2^n) k/(2^n) bb(1)_(A_(n, k)), wide A_(n, k) := {(x, y) in [-n, n]^2 : k/(2^n) <= f(x, y) < (k+1)/(2^n)},thin thin k = 0, 1, dots, n 2^n.
  $ So, $
  integral_(RR^2) f(x, y) dif x dif y = lim_(n) sum_(k=0)^(n 2^n) k/(2^n) m(A_(n,k)).
  $ On the other hand, $forall x in RR$, by MON $
  I_(f)^((1)) (x) = integral_RR f(x, y) dif y &= lim_(n->infinity) integral_RR phi_n (x, y) dif y\
  &=lim_(n->infinity) sum_(k=0)^(n 2^n) k/(2^n) I^((1))_(A_(n,k)) (x)\
  &= lim_(n->infinity) sum_(k=0)^(n 2^n) k/(2^n) m((A_(n,k))_x).
  $ We have then, again by MON, that $
  integral_(RR) I_(f)^((1)) (x) dif x = lim_(n->infinity) integral_(RR) sum_(k=0)^(n 2^n) k/(2^n) I^((1))_(A_(n,k)) (x) dif x = lim_(n->infinity) sum_(k=0)^(n 2^n) k/(2^n) integral_RR I_(A_(n,k))^((1)) (x) dif x.
  $ Similarly, we find $
  integral_(RR) I_f^((2)) (y) dif y = lim_(n->infinity) sum_(k=0)^(n 2^n) k/(2^n) integral_RR I_(A_(n, k))^((2)) (y) dif y.
  $ By definition, $
  m(A_(n, k)) = integral_(RR) I_(A_(n,k))^((1))(x) dif x = integral_(RR) I_(A_(n,k))^((2))(y) dif y, 
  $ hence all of our terms actually agree, and bringing them together gives the proof.

 integral_RR I_(f^+)^((1)) (x) dif x = integral_RR I_(f^+)^((2)) (y) dif y = integral_(RR^2) f^+ (x, y) dif x dif y < infinity,
 $ same with $f^-$. Then, $I^((1))_(f^+), I^((2))_(f^+), I^((1))_(f^-), I^((2))_(f^-) in L^1 (RR)$, hence are finite-valued a.e.. By linearity on $L^1$ functions, then $
 integral_(RR) I_(f^+)^((1)) (x) dif x - integral_(RR) I_(f^-)^((1)) (x) dif x = integral_(RR) I_(f^+)^((1)) - I_(f^-)^((1)).
 $ For a.e. $x in RR$, $f_(x)^+, f_x^- in L^1 (RR)$, so by linearity $
 I_(f^+)^((1)) (x) - I_(f^-)^((1)) (x) = integral_(RR) f_(x)^+ (y) dif y - integral_(RR) f_x^- (y) dif y = integral_(RR) (f_x^+ - f_x^-) = integral_RR f_x,
 $ so $
 integral_RR I_(f^+)^((1)) - integral_RR I_(f^-)^((1)) = integral_RR I_f^((1)),

 integral_RR I_(f^+)^((2)) - integral_RR I_(f^-)^((2)) = integral_RR I_f^((2)).

  In general, $I_f^((1)), I_f^((2)) in L^1 (RR) arrow.r.double.not f in L^1 (RR^2)$. For instance, let $

  If $f : RR^2 -> overline(R)$ is $overline(cal(M)^2)$-measurable, Tonelli's, Fubini's still hold. We'll use the same notations in this case.

= Differentiation

In the Riemann setting, differentiation and integration are closely related. For instance, if $F(x) := integral_(a)^x f(t) dif t$ for some Riemann-integrable $f$ on $[a, b]$ and $x in [a, b]$, then $F$ is differentiable and $F' = f$ on $(a, b)$. Or, if $F$ differentiable, and $F'$ is Riemann integrable on some $[a, b]$, then $F(b) - F(a) = integral_(a)^b F'(t) dif t$. How much does this extend to the Lebesgue setting?

== Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Function

#definition("Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Function")[Suppose $f in L^1 (RR)$. The _Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Function_ (H-L max.), denoted $f^ast$, is defined as $
f^ast (x) := sup_(I in cal(I)(x)) 1/(m(I)) integral_I |f|,
 $ where $cal(I)(x) := {I : I "an open interval containing" x}$.
]

#proposition[
  Given $f in L^1 (RR)$, $f^ast$ is measurable.
]

#proof[
  $f^ast >= 0$, so it suffices to show that for every $a >= 0$, ${f^ast > a}$ is measurable. Let $x in {f^ast > a}$. Then, $a < f^ast (x)$, hence there must exist some $I in cal(I)(x)$ such that $1/(m(I)) integral_(I) |f| > a$. $I$ is open, and $x in I$, so there exists some $delta > 0$ such that $(x - delta, x + delta) subset.eq I$. For every $y in (x - delta, x + delta)$, $y in I$, hence $I in cal(I)(y)$. So, $f^ast (y) >= 1/(m(I)) integral_I |f| > a$. Thus, $y in {f^ast > a}$ as well. It follows, then, that $(x - delta, x + delta) subset.eq {f^ast > a}$, hence ${f^ast > a}$ is open, and so in particular is measurable.

#lemma("Vitali's Covering Lemma")[
  Assume that $cal(I) := {I_1, dots, I_N}$ a finite collection of open intervals. Then, there exists a sub-collection ${I_(k_1), dots, I_(k_M)} subset cal(I)$ such that $I_(k_i) sect I_(k_j) = nothing$ for all $i eq.not j$ and $
  m(union.big_(i=1)^N I_(i)) <= 3sum_(j=1)^M m(I_(k_j)).
  $
]
#proof[
  Assume wlog that $m(I_i) < infinity$ for all $1 <= i <= N$; if otherwise exists an $i$ such that $m(I_i) = infinity$, then simply take your subcollection $I_k_1 := I_i$, and the claim holds trivially. 

  Begin with the largest interval in $cal(I)$, call it $I_k_1$. Let $
  cal(I)_(k_1) := {I in cal(I) : I sect I_(k_1) eq.not nothing}.
  $ For any $I in cal(I)_(k_1)$, $I sect I_(k_1) eq.not nothing$ and $m(I) <= m(I_k_1)$, so in particular $I subset.eq 3 I_(k_1)$ (if $I_k_1 = (a, b)$, $3 I_k_1 := (a-3(b-a), a+3(b-a))$). // TODO check.

  Then, in particular $
  union.big_(I in cal(I)_(k_1)) I subset.eq 3 I_(k_1).
  $ Consider now $cal(I)\\cal(I)_(k_1)$, and choose the largest interval in the remaining part of the collection. Call it $I_(k_2)$. Set $
  cal(I)_k_2 := {I in cal(I)\\cal(I)_(k_1) : I sect I_k_2 eq.not nothing}.
  $ Similarly to before, $union.big_(I in cal(I)_(k_2)) I subset.eq 3 I_k_2.$ By choice, too, $I_k_1 sect I_k_2 = nothing$. 
  
  Repeat this process, until $cal(I)\\ (cal(I)_k_1 union dots.c union cal(I)_k_M) = nothing$, i.e. we have no intervals left in the original collection. Then, we obtain $I_k_1, dots, I_k_M$ disjoint intervals, with corresponding subcollections $cal(I)_k_1, dots, cal(I)_k_M$ forming a partition of $cal(I)$. Then, $
  m(union.big_(n=1)^N I_n) = sum_(j=1)^M m(union.big_(I in cal(I)_(k_j)) I)
 <= 3 sum_(j=1)^M m(I_k_j).

  Suppose $f in L^1 (R)$ and let $f^ast$ be the H-L max function of $f$. Then, for every $epsilon > 0$, $
  m({x in RR : f^ast (x) > epsilon}) <= 3/epsilon ||f||_1 = 3/epsilon integral_RR |f|.
  $
]

#proof[
Fix $epsilon>0$ and put $B := { x in RR : f^ast (x) > epsilon}$. By inner regularity, $
m(B) = sup {m(K) : B supset.eq K "compact"}.
$ It suffices to show then that $m(K) <= 3/epsilon ||f||_1$ for every compact $K subset.eq B$. For every $x in K$, $f^ast (x) > epsilon$ so there exists some open interval $I_x$ such that $x in I_x$ and $1/(m(I_x)) integral_(I_x) |f| > epsilon$. Hence, we may cover $K subset.eq union.big_(x in K) I_x$. Since $K$ compact it admits a finite subinterval, call it $cal(I) = {I_1, dots, I_N}$, such that $K subset.eq union.big_(n=1)^N I_n$. By the Covering Lemma, $
m(K) <= m(union.big_(n=1)^N I_n) <= 3 sum_(j=1)^M m(I_k_j),
$ for some disjoint subcollection $I_k_1, dots, I_k_M$. Meanwhile, for every $1 <= j <= M$, $
m(I_k_j) < 1/epsilon integral_(I_k_j) |f|,
$ hence, we find $
m(K) <= 3 sum_(j=1)^M 1/epsilon integral_(I_k_j) |f| = 3/epsilon integral_(union.big_(j=1)^M I_k_j) |f|  <= 3/epsilon integral_RR |f| = 3/epsilon ||f||_1.
$
]

#corollary[
  Given $f in L^1 (RR)$, $f^ast$ is finite-valued a.e..
]
#proof[
  For every $N > 0$, $m({f^ast > N}) <= 3/N ||f||_1$. Taking $N -> infinity$, we find then $m({f^ast > N}) -> 0$, and since $m({f^ast = infinity}) <= m({f^ast > N}) forall N > 0$ it follows that $m({f^ast = infinity}) = 0$.
]

#remark[While a Markov-like inequality, $f^ast$ need not be integrable in general. For instance, let $f = bb(1)_[-1, 1] in L^1 (RR)$. Then, consider $f^ast$, and in particular consider the average of $f$ over intervals $I = (a, b)$; $
1/(b - a) integral_a^b f(t) dif t = cases(
0 & "if" (a, b) sect [-1, 1] = nothing, 
(min{b, 1} - max{a, -1})/(b - a) & "if" (a, b) sect [-1, 1] eq.not nothing.
).
$ So, we find that $f^ast (x) = 1$ if $x in (-1, 1)$ (take your $I =[-1, 1]$, this achieves max), and $f^ast (x) = 2/(|x| + 1)$ if $x in.not (-1, 1)$ (you want as much of the $[-1, 1]$ support as possible, and with your other endpoint as close to $x$ as possible). // TODO pictures

== Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem
#theorem("Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem")[
  Given $f in L^1 (RR)$, for a.e. $x in RR$, if ${I_n}$ a sequence of open intervals such that $x in I_n forall n >= 1$ and $lim_(n->infinity) m(I_n) = 0$ (we say ${I_n}$ a sequence of intervals _shrinking to $x$_), then $
  lim_(n->infinity) 1/(m(I_n)) integral_(I_n) |f(t) - f(x)| dif t = 0.
  $ In particular, $
  lim_(n->infinity) 1/(m(I_n)) integral_(I_n) f(t) dif t = f(x).
  $
]

#proof[
  The "In particular" comes from the fact that, for $x$ such that $f(x) < infinity$, $
  |1/(m(I_n)) integral_(I_n) f(t) dif t - f(x)| &= abs(1/(m(I_n)) integral_(I_n) f(t) - f(x) dif t) <= 1/(m(I_n)) integral_(I_n) abs(f(t) - f(x)) dif t,
  $ so if the RHS $-> 0$, so does the left.

  Without loss of generality, assume $f$ finite valued everywhere, and only use finite-valued intervals $I_n$. For every $k >= 1$, define $
  B_k := {x in RR : exists {I_n} subset.eq cal(I)(x) "with" lim_(n->infinity) m(I_n) = 0 "s.t." limsup_(n->infinity) 1/(m(I_n)) integral_(I_n) |f(t) - f(x)| dif t >= 1/k}.
  $ Notice $B_k arrow.t$ and $union.big_(k=1)^infinity B_k = {x in RR : "theorem fails"}$. So, it suffices to show that $m(B_k) = 0$ for every $k >= 1$.

  Fix an arbitrary $epsilon > 0$. Continuous, compactly supported functions are dense in $L^1 (RR)$ so we may find $g in C_c (RR)$ such that $||f - g||_1 <= epsilon$. Since $g$ continuous and compactly supported, for every $x in RR$ and $k >= 1$, there exists some $alpha > 0$ such that if $|t - x| <= alpha$, $|g(t)-g(x)| <= 1/(3 k)$.

  Given any $x in RR$ and any sequence ${I_n} subset.eq cal(I)(x)$ with $lim_n m(I_n) = 0$, we have$
  1/(m(I_n)) integral_(I_n) |f(t) - f(x)| dif t & <= 1/(m(I_n)) integral_(I_n) |f(t) - g(t)| dif t wide &(1)\
  & wide + 1/(m(I_n)) integral_(I_n) |g(t) - g(x)| dif t  wide &(2)\
  & wide + |g(x) - f(x)| wide &(3)
  $ by triangle inequality, adding/subtracting $g(t), g(x)$. We know that when $n$ sufficiently large such that $m(I_n) < alpha$, $|g(t) - g(x)| <= 1/(3 k) forall t in I_n$, hence $(2) <= 1/(3k)$ for sufficiently large $n$. For $x$ to be in $B_k$, we need too that $limsup_n ( (1)+(2)+(3)) > 1/k$. But we know that $(2) <= 1/(3k)$ for all sufficiently large $n$, we must have that $limsup_(n)((1) + (3)) > 2/(3 k)$. Let $
  C_k := {x in RR : limsup_n (1) > 1/(3 k)}, wide D_k := {x in RR : limsup_n (3) > 1/(3 k)},
  $ then remark $m(B_k) <= m(C_k) + m(D_k)$ since $B_k subset.eq C_k union D_k$. Then, $
  m(D_k) = m({|f - g|  > 1/(3 k)}) <= 3k ||f - g||_1 <= 3 k epsilon,
  $ by Markov's, and $
  m(C_k) &= m({limsup_n 1/(m(I_n)) integral(I_n) |f - g| > 1/(3k)}) \
  &<= m({(f-g)^ast > 1/(3 k)}) <= 3 dot 3 k ||f - g||_1 = 9 k epsilon,
  $ by using the previous H-L inequality. Hence, we find $
  m(B_k) <= 12 k epsilon,
  $ and, sending $epsilon -> 0$ we find $m(B_k) = 0$, completing the proof.

1/(m(I_n)) integral_(I_n) f = 2/n integral_(-1/n)^(1/n) bb(1)_([0,1]) = 1/2 eq.not f(0),

#proof[
(i) $=>$ (ii) by translation of the integral.

If $x in RR$ is such that (i) fails, then there is a sequence ${h_n} in RR^+$ such that $lim h_n = 0$ and $lim_n 1/(2 h_n) integral_(x - h_n)^(x + h_n) |f(t)-f(x)| dif t eq.not 0$. Then, the Lebesgue Diff Thm fails at $x$ for $I_n = (x - h_n, x + h_n)$ so $x$ not a Lebesgue point. Hence, ${x : "(i) fails"}$ a null set.

In particular, this implies that $lim_(h-> 0) 1/(2 h) integral_(x-h)^(x+h) f(t) dif t = f(x)$ for a.e. $x in RR$, so as a function of $x$, $lim_(h-> 0) 1/(2 h) integral_(x-h)^(x+h) f(t) dif t$ measurable.

Apply LDT to $|f|$. This implies that for a.e. $x in RR$, $|f(x)| = lim_(n->infinity) 1/(m(I_n)) integral_(I_n) |f(t)| dif t$, $I_n := (x - 1/n, x + 1/n)$.

#proof[
Recall $f^ast < infinity$ a.e.. Let $A_N := {f^ast > N}$, then $bb(1)_A_N -> 0$ almost everywhere as $N -> infinity$. Hence, $
lim_(N->infinity) integral_(RR) bb(1)_(A_N) |f| = 0
$ by DOM, and so $
integral_({f^ast > N}) |f| -> 0
$ as $N -> infinity$. Given $epsilon$, then, $exists N$ such that $integral_({f^ast > N}) |f| <= epsilon/2$. Let $delta = epsilon/(2N)$. Then, for every $I$ (wlog open) with $m(I) < delta$, $
integral_(I) |f| &= integral_(I sect {f^ast > N}) |f| + integral_(I sect {f^ast <= N}) |f| \ 
& <= integral_({f^ast > N}) |f| + integral_(I sect {f^ast <= N}) |f| \
&<= epsilon/2 + N dot m(I) \ 
&<=epsilon/2 + N epsilon/(2 N) = epsilon.
$
]

#proof[(of @thm:sudoftc) For every $epsilon > 0$, let $delta > 0$ as in the lemma. Then for every $x > y >= a$ such that $|x - y| <= delta$, $
|F(x) - F(y)| = |integral_(y)^x f(t) dif t| <= integral_((y, x)) |f| <= epsilon,
$ so $F$ uniformly continuous.

Let $x in RR$ be a Lebesgue point of $f$ and such that $f(x)$ is finite valued. Then, $
abs(1/h (F(x+h) - F(x)) - f(x)) &= abs(1/h integral_(x)^(x+h) f(t) dif t - f(x)) \

& <= 2 1/(2h) integral_(x - h)^(x + h) abs(f(t) - f(x)) dif x -> 0 "as" h -> 0^+.

#proposition[
  Assume $F$ increasing on $[a, b]$. Then, $F'$ exists a.e. on $[a, b]$.
]

#proof[
  For every $x in [a, b]$, $dru F(x) <= dro F(x), dlu F(x) <= dlo F(x)$. If we can show $dro F(x) <= dlu F(x)$ and $dlo F(x) <= dru F(x)$ a.e., we'd be done.

  Set $E := {x in [a, b] : dlo F(x) > dru F(x)}$. We want to show $m(E) = 0$. For $p < q in QQ,$ set $
  E_(p q) := {x in [a, b] : dlo F(x) > q "and" dru F(x) < p}.
  $ Notice that $E = union.big_(p < q in QQ) E_(p, q)$, which is a countable union, so it suffices to show that $m(E_(p, q)) =0$.
  
  Suppose otherwise, that there is some $delta > 0$ such that $m(E_(p, q)) = delta$. fix any $0 < epsilon < delta/2$. Choose an open $G supset.eq E_(p, q) $ with $m(G) <= m(E_(p, q)) + epsilon = delta + epsilon$. Consider $
  cal(J) := {I = [x, x+h] subset.eq G : (F(x + h) - F(x))/h < p} .
  $ For every $x in E_(p, q)$, $x in G$-open, and $dru F(x) < p$. So, for every $x in E_(p, q)$, there exists $I = [x, x + h] in cal(J)$ for arbitrarly small $h$. In particular, $cal(J)$ a _Vitali covering_ of $E_(p, q)$ (see following lemma). Hence, there exists a disjoint subcollection $I_1, dots, I_N in cal(J)$ such that $m(E_(p, q) \\ union.big_(i=1)^N I_i) <= epsilon$. Write $I_i = [x_i, x_i + h_i], i = 1, dots, N$. Define $
  tilde(G) := union.big_(i=1)^N (x_i, x_i + h_i), wide tilde(E_(p, q)) = E_(p, q) sect tilde(G).
  $ Then, $
  m(tilde(E_(p,q))) = m(E_(p, q) sect tilde(G)) = m(E_(p, q) sect union.big_(i=1)^N I_n) = m(E_(p, q)) - m(E_(p, q)\\union.big_(i=1)^N I_i) >= delta - epsilon.
  $ Since $tilde(E_(p, q)) subset.eq tilde(G)$ and $tilde(G)$ is open, define $tilde(cal(J)) := {tilde(I) = [y - r, y]  subset.eq tilde(G) : (F(y) - F(y - r))/(r) > q}$. Then, $tilde(J)$ is a Vitali covering of $tilde(E_(p, q))$, and we can extract disjoint $tilde(I_1), dots, tilde(I_M) in tilde(cal(J))$ such that $m(tilde(E_(p, q))\\union.big_(j=1)^M tilde(I_j))  <= epsilon$. Hence, $
  m(union.big_(j=1)^M tilde(I_j)) &= m(tilde(E_(p,q))) - m(tilde(E_(p, q))\\union.big_(j=1)^M tilde(I_j)) \ 
  &>= delta -  epsilon - epsilon = delta - 2 epsilon.
  $ Write $tilde(I_j) := [y_j - r_j, y_j], j = 1, dots, M$. Then, $tilde(I_1), dots, tilde(I_M)$ form a disjoint subintervals of $I_1, dots, I_N$. Since $F$ is increasing, $
  sum_(j=1)^M (F(y_j) - F(y_j - r_j)) <= sum_(i=1)^N (F(x_i + h) - F(x_i)).
  $ We have that $
  "RHS" <= p sum_(i=1)^N h_i = p m(union.big_(i=1)^N I_i) <= p m(G) <= p (delta + epsilon),
  $ and similarly, $
  "LHS" >= q sum_(j=1)^M r_j = q m(union.big_(j=1)^M tilde(I_j)) >= q (delta - 2 epsilon),
  $ hence we find $
  q (delta - 2 epsilon) <= p (delta + epsilon),
  $ but $epsilon$ arbitrary, so we find $q delta <= p delta$, contradicting $p < q$, hence $delta = 0$.

#lemma("Vitali's Covering Theorem")[
  Given a set $E subset.eq RR$, a collection $cal(J)$ of intervals is called a _Vitali covering_ of $E$ if for every $x in E$ and $epsilon > 0$, there is an $I in cal(J)$ such that $x in I$ and $m(I) < epsilon$.

  If $E in cal(M)$ with $m(E) < infinity$ and $cal(J)$ a Vitali covering of $E$, then for every $epsilon > 0$, there is a finite subcollection $I_1, I_2, dots, I_N in cal(J)$ such that $I_i sect I_j = nothing$ for $i eq.not j$, and $
  m(E \\ union.big_(i=1)^N I_i) <= epsilon.
  $
]

#proof[
  Assume, wlog, $m(union.big_(I in cal(J)) I) < infinity$. Else, let $G$ open such that $G supset.eq E$ and $m(G) < infinity$, and redefine $cal(J)' := {I in cal(J) : I subset.eq G}$, then, if $cal(J)$ a Vitali covering of $E$, so is $cal(J)'$. Defining then $
  alpha_1 := sup {m(I) : I in cal(J)},
  $ we know $alpha_1 < infinity$. Then, $exists I_1 in cal(J)$ such that $m(I_1) > (alpha_1)/2$. Then, consider $
  cal(J)_1 := {I in cal(J) : I sect I_1 = nothing}.
  $ Define $
  alpha_2 := sup{m(I) : I in cal(J)_1} < infinity,
  $ so there exists $I_2 in cal(J)_1$ such that $m(I_2) > (alpha_2)/2$, and put $cal(J)_2 := {I in cal(J) : I sect I_1 = nothing "and" I sect I_2 = nothing}$. Repeat this procedure; this will generate a sequence ${alpha_k}$ and ${I_k}$ such that the $I_k$'s are disjoint, and $alpha_k = sup{m(I) : I in cal(J), I sect I_j = nothing forall j = 1, dots, k - 1}$. Since $union.big_(k=1)^infinity I_k subset.eq union.big_(I in cal(J)) I$ and disjointness,$
  sum_(k=1)^infinity m(I_k) = m(union.big_(k=1)^infinity I_k) < infinity.
  $ In addition, $m(I_k) > (alpha_k)/2$ hence $sum_(k=1)^infinity m(I_k) >= sum_(k=1)^infinity (alpha_k)/2$, noticing that $alpha_k -> 0$ as $k -> infinity$ and in particular this means $sum_(k=1)^infinity (alpha_k)/2$ a converging series. Fix $epsilon > 0$, then there exists some $N$ sufficiently large such that $
  sum_(k=N+1)^infinity m(I_k) < epsilon/5.
  $ We claim that ${I_i}_(i=1)^N$ satisfies our desired properties, namely that $m(E \\ union.big_(i=1)^N I_i) < epsilon$. It suffices to show $m(E \\ union.big_(i=1)^N overline(I_i)) < epsilon$, since this adds/removes only points so doesn't change the measure. Since $union.big_(i=1)^N overline(I_i)$ closed, then for every $x in E\\ union.big_(i=1)^N overline(I_i)$, $"dist"(x, union.big_(i=1)^N overline(I_i)) = lambda > 0$. Since $cal(J)$ a Vitali covering, there is some $I^ast in cal(J)$ such that $x in I^ast$ and $m(I^ast) < lambda$. Hence, it must be that $I^ast sect I_i = nothing$ for every $i = 1, dots, N$. Hence, $m(I^ast) <= alpha_(N+1)$. Let $N^ast >= N+1$ be such that $alpha_(N^ast + 1) < m(I^ast) <= alpha_(N^ast)$. So, there is a $j = N + 1, dots, N^ast$ such that $I^ast sect I_j eq.not nothing$ (we "start seeing" $I^ast$ at the $j$th step). Now, $
  m(I^ast) <= alpha_(N^ast) <= alpha_j <= 2 m(I_j).
  $ In particular, $I^ast subset.eq \"5 I_j\"$, where $5 I_j$ is $I_j$ "expanded" $5$ times. So, $

#proposition[
  Assume $F : [a, b] -> RR$ is increasing. Then, $F' in L^1 ([a, b])$, $F' >= 0$ a.e. on $[a, b]$, and $integral_(a)^b F'(t) dif t <= F(b) - F(a)$.
]

#proof[
  $F' >= 0$ clear. For a.e. $x in [a, b]$, $F' (x) = lim_(n->infinity) G_n (x)$ where $G_n (x) := (F(x + 1/n) - F(x))/(1/n)$, expanding $F$ to be constant its last value outside of $[a, b]$ if necessary. Then, by Fatou, $
    integral_(a)^b F'(x) dif x &<=  liminf_(n) integral_(a)^b G_n (x)dif x \ 
    &= liminf_n (n (integral_(a)^b F(x + 1/n) dif x - integral_(a)^b F(x) dif x)) \ 
    &= liminf_n (n (integral_(a + 1/n)^(b + 1/n) F(t) dif t - integral_(a)^b F(t) dif t)) \ 
    &= liminf_n (n( integral_(b)^(b + 1/n) F(t) dif t - integral_(a)^(a + 1/n) F(t) dif t))\
    &<= liminf_(n) (n (F(b) 1/n - F(a) 1/n)) = F(b) - F(a).
  $ This proves in turn $F' in L^1 ([a, b])$.
]
#remark[
  The inequality established may be strict. Recall $f$ the Cantor-Lebesgue function. It is continuous and increasing, so $f'$ exists almost everywhere on $[0, 1]$, indeed, for every $x in [0, 1]\\C$, $f'(x) = 0$. Then, $f' equiv 0$ a.e. on $[0, 1]$ so $integral_(0)^1 f'(x) dif x = 0$, while $f(1) - f(0) = 1$.

== Functions of Bounded Variation
#definition("Bounded Variation")[
  A function $F : [a, b] -> RR$ is of _bounded variation_ on $[a, b]$, denoted by $f in "BV"([a, b])$ if $
  T_F (a, b) := sup {sum_(k=1)^N |F(x_k) - F(x_(k-1))| : N >= 1, a = x_0 < x_1 < x_2 <dots.c < x_N = b} < infinity.
  $ We call $x_0, dots, x_N$ a partition of $[a, b]$, and $T_F$ the _total variation_ of $F$ over $[a, b]$.
]

#proposition[
  1. For $x in [a, b]$, set $V_F (x) := T_F (a, x)$. Then, $V_F : [a, b] -> [0, infinity]$ is increasing and for every $a <= x <= y <= b$, $V_F (y) - V_F (x) = T_F ((x, y))$.
  2. If $F, G in "BV"([a, b])$, then both $F + G, F - G in "BV"([a, b])$ and $T_(F + G) (a, b) <= T_F (a, b) + T_G (a, b)$.
  3. If $F$ is monotonic on $[a, b]$, $F in "BV"([a, b])$.
  4. If $f in L^1 (RR)$ and $F(x) := integral_(a)^x f(t) dif t$ for $x in [a, b]$, then $F in "BV"([a, b])$ and $T_F (a, b) <= integral_(a)^b |f(t)| dif t$.
  5. If $F in "BV"([a, b])$, $F$ is bounded on $[a, b]$.
  6. If $F$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable everywhere on $(a, b)$, and there is some $M > 0$ such that $|F'(x)| <= M$ for every $x in (a, b)$, then $F in "BV"([a, b])$. 
  7. In 6., the boundedness of $F'$ cannot be dropped.
]

#proof[
  3. For any partition $a = x_0 < dots.c < x_N = b$, we have $
  sum_(k=1)^N |F(x_k) - F(x_(k-1))| = sum_(k=1)^N F(x_k) - F(x_(k-1)) = F(b) - F(a),
  $ which was true of any partition so in particular $T_F (a, b) = |F(b) - F(a)|$.
  4. For any partition $a = x_0 < dots.c < x_N = b$, $
  sum_(k=1)^N |F(x_k) - F(x_(k-1))| &=  sum_(k=1)^N |integral_(x_(k-1))^(x_k) f(t) dif t| \ 
  &<= sum_(k=1)^N integral_(x_(k-1))^(x_k) |f(t)| dif t = integral_(a)^b |f(t)| dif t < infinity.
  $
  5. For every $x in [a, b]$, $
  |F(x)| <= |F(x) - F(a)| + |F(a)| &<=  T_F (a, x) + |F(a)| \ 
  &<= T_F (a, b) + |F(a)| < infinity.
  $
  6. By the mean value theorem, for every $x < y in (a, b)$, there is some $z in (x, y)$ such that $(F(y) - F(x))/(y - x) = F'(z)$. Hence, for every such $x, y$, $
  |F(y) - F(x)| <= M (y - x).
  $ For any partition $a = x_0 < dots.c < x_N = b$, then, $
  sum_(k=1)^N |F(x_k) - F(x_(k-1))| <= M (b - a).$
  7. For instance, consider $F(x) = cases(x sin (1/(x^2)) wide & x eq.not 0, 0 & x = 0)$. Then $F$ continuous on $[0, 1]$ and differentiable on $(0, 1)$, but $F in.not "BV"([0, 1])$.
]

#theorem[A function $F : [a, b] -> RR$ is in $"BV"([a, b])$ if and only if there exist $H, G : [a, b] -> RR$ increasing such that $F(x) = H(x) - G(x)$ for every $x in [a, b]$.]

#proof[
  ($arrow.l.double$) Increasing functions are in $"BV"([a, b])$, so $H, G$ and thus $H - G in "BV"([a, b])$.

  ($=>$) Assume $F in "BV"([a, b])$. Let $H(x) = V_F (x)$ for $x in [a, b]$, which is increasing on $[a, b]$. Let $G = H - F$, which we claim is also increasing. For every $x < y in [a, b]$, $
  G(y) - G(x) &= H(y) - H(x) - (F(y) - F(x)) \ 
  &= T_F (x, y) - (F(y) - F(x)) \ 
  &>= T_F (x, y) - |F(y) - F(x)| >= 0.
  $
]

#theorem[
  If $F : [a, b] -> RR$ is of bounded variation, then $F$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ except at at most countably many points, $F'$ exists almost everywhere on $[a, b]$, and $F' in L^1 ([a, b])$.

== Absolutely Continuous Functions

#definition("Absolutely Continuous")[A function $F : [a, b] -> RR$ is called _absolutely continuous_ on $[a, b]$, denoted $F in "AC"([a, b])$, if for every $epsilon > 0$ there is a $delta > 0$ such that for any disjoint intervals $(a_k, b_k) subset.eq (a, b), k = 1, dots, N$ with $sum_(k=1)^N (b_k - a_k) <= delta$, it holds that $
sum_(k=1)^N |F(b_k) - F(a_k)| <= epsilon.
$]

#remark[
  The ${(a_k, b_k)}$'s need not partition $(a, b)$.
]

#proposition([Properties of $"AC"([a, b])$])[
1. $F in "AC"([a, b]) =>F$ is uniformly continuous on $[a, b]$.
2. If $f in L^1 ([a, b])$ and $F(x) := integral_(a)^x f(t) dif t$ for $x in [a, b]$, then $F in "AC"([a, b])$.
3. If $F, G in "AC"([a, b])$ then $F + G, F - G in "AC"([a, b])$.
4. If $F in "AC"([a, b])$, then $F in "BV"([a, b])$.
5. If $F$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable everywhere on $(a, b)$ and there is some $M > 0$ such that $|F'(x)| <= M$ for every $x in (a, b)$, then $F in "AC"([a, b])$.
]

#proof[
  1. For $epsilon > 0$, let $delta$ as in the definition, then for every $x, y in [a, b] , x < y$, if $y - x < delta$, $|F(y) - F(x)| <= epsilon$ (namely, taking a single interval in the definition of $"AC"([a, b])$).
  2. Recall that $forall epsilon < 0$, there is a constant $M > 0$ such that $integral_{f^ast > M} |f| < epsilon/2$. Let $delta = epsilon/(2 M)$. Then, for every $(a_k, b_k) subset.eq (a, b)$ disjoint, $k = 1, dots, N$ such that $sum_(k=1)^N (b_k - a_k) <= delta,$ we have $
  sum_(k=1)^N |F(b_k) - F(a_k)| &<= sum_(k=1)^N integral_(a_k)^b_k |f| \ 
  &= sum_(k=1)^N integral_((a_k, b_k) sect {f^ast > M}) |f| + sum_(k=1)^N integral_((a_k, b_k) sect {f^ast <= M}) |f| \ 
  &<= integral_(union.big_(k=1)^N (a_k, b_k) sect {f^ast > M}) |f| + M sum_(k=1)^N (b_k - a_k) \ 
  &<= epsilon/2 + M delta = epsilon.
  $
  4. Let $epsilon = 1$ and take $delta$ in the definition of AC. Consider a partition of $[a, b]$, $a = t_0 < dots.c < t_L = b$ such that $t_(i+1) - t_i = (b - a)/L$ and $L$ is such that $(b - a)/L <= delta$. For each $i = 0, dots, L$, take any partition of $[t_i, t_(i+1)]$, $t_i = x_0 < dots.c < x_N t_(i+1)$. Then, $(x_k, x_(k+1))$'s are disjoint and $sum_(k=0)^(N-1) (x_(k+1) - x_k ) = t_(i+1) - t_i <= delta$. So, $sum_(k=0)^(N-1) |F(x_(k+1)) - F(x_k)| <= 1$ i.e. $T_F (t_(i), t_(i+1)) <= 1$. Then, $T_F (a, b) <= sum_(i=0)^(L-1) T_F (t_i - t_(i+1)) <= L < infinity$.
  5. Use mean value theorem and the similar proof for $"BV"([a, b])$.

#theorem[If $F in "AC"([a, b])$, then $F'$ exists a.e. on $[a, b]$ and $F' in L^1 ([a, b])$.]

#proof[
  $"AC"([a, b]) subset.eq "BV"([a, b])$, and the same property holds for $"BV"([a, b])$.
]

#theorem[
  Given $F in "AC"([a, b])$, $F$ is constant on $[a, b]$, that is, there is some $c in RR$ such that $F(x) = c$ for every $x in [a, b]$ if and only if $F' = 0$ a.e. on $[a, b]$.
]

#proof[
  ($=>$) If $F equiv c$, $F' equiv 0$ on $(a, b)$.

  ($impliedby$) Assume $F in "AC"([a, b])$ and $F' = 0$ a.e. on $[a, b]$. We want to show that for every $c in (a, b]$, $F(c) = F(a)$. Fix $c in (a, b]$. Set $E = {x in [a, c] : F'(x) = 0}$, so $m([a, c]\\E) = 0$. Fix $epsilon > 0$, let $delta > 0$ as in the definition of $"AC"$, and let $
  cal(J) := {I = [x, x+h] subset.eq (a, c) : x in E, h > 0, |F(x+h)-F(x)| <= epsilon h}.
  $ Then, for every $x in E$, $x in (a, c)$ and $F'(x) = 0$ so there is some $I = [x, x + h] in cal(J)$ with $x in I$ and $h$ arbitrarily small. So in particular, $cal(J)$ a Vitali covering of $E$. Then, there are disjoint $I_1, dots, I_N in cal(J)$ such that $m(E\\union.big_(i=1)^N I_i) <= delta$. Hence, $m([a, c] \\ union.big_(i=1)^N I_i) <= delta$. Denote $I_i = [x_i, x_i + h]$, and relabel so that they are increasing, namely $x_1 < x_1 + h_1 < x_2 < x_2 + h_2 < dots.c < x_N < x_(N) + h_N$. For every $i = 1, dots, N$, $|F(x_i + h_i) - F(x_i)| <= epsilon h_i$, by construction. So, notice that $
  |F(a) - F(c)| &<= |F(a) - F(x_1)| + underbrace(sum_(i=1)^(N) |F(x_i + h_i) - F(x_i)|, <= epsilon sum_(i=1)^N h_i \ <= epsilon (c-a)) + sum_(i=1)^(N-1) |F(x_(i+1)) - F(x_i + h_i)| + |F(c) - F(x_N + h_N)|.
  $ The remaining intervals to deal with are $(a, x_1), {(x_i + h_i, x_(i+1))}, (x_N + h_N, c)$. These are all disjoint, and the union of them equals $(a, c)\\union.big_(i=1)^N I_i$. Hence, the sum of the lengths of these intervals is bounded by $delta$. So, $|F(x_1) - F(a)| + sum_(i=1)^N |F(x_(i+1)) - F(x_(i) + h_i)| + |F(c) - F(x_N + h_N)| <= epsilon$ by AC. Thus, $
  |F(a) - F(c)| <= epsilon + epsilon (c - a) = epsilon ( c - a + 1),
  $  and since $epsilon$ arbitrarily small, it must be that $F(a) = F(c)$, completing the proof.
]

#remark[
  The condition $F in "AC"([a, b])$ cannot be dropped. Namely, if $F$ is the Cantor-Lebesgue function on $[0, 1]$, then $F' equiv 0$ a.e. but $F$ is not constant. In particular, $F$ is not $"AC"([0, 1])$, but is $"BV"([0, 1])$, being an increasing function.
]

#theorem("Fundamental Theorem of Calculus")[
  If $F in "AC"([a, b])$, then $F'$ exists almost everywhere on $[a, b]$, $F' in L^1 ([a, b])$, and for every $x in [a, b]$, $
  F(x) - F(a) = integral_(a)^x F' (t) dif t.
  $ In particular, $F(b) - F(a) = integral_(a)^b F'(t) dif t$.
]

#proof[
Assume $F in "AC"([a, b])$. Define $G(x) := F(a) + integral_(a)^x F'(t) dif t$ for every $x in [a, b]$. Then, since $F' in L^1 (RR)$, $integral_a^x F'(t) dif t in "AC"([a, b])$ so $G in "AC"([a, b])$. Moreover, by theorem 4.2, $G' = F'$ almost everywhere on $[a, b]$. // TODO why? 
 Thus, $H := F - G in "AC"([a, b])$ and $H' = F' - G' = 0$ almost everywhere on $[a, b]$ hence $H(x) = H(a) = 0$ for every $x in [a, b]$. Hence, $F (x) = G(x) = F(a) + integral_a^x F'(t) dif t$ for every $x in [a, b]$.

= A Glance Towards Probability Theory

Assume $mu$ a probability measure on $(RR, frak(B)_RR)$. Define $F_mu (x) := mu((-infinity, x])$ for $x in RR$, called the distribution function of $mu$. Then, 
1. $F_mu$ increasing.
2. $lim_(x -> infinity) F_mu (x) = 1$ and $lim_(x -> - infinity) F_mu (x) = 0$.
3. $F_mu$ has at most countably many discontinuities and $F_mu$ is RCLL (right continuous with left-handed limits) i.e. for every $x in RR$, $F_mu (x+) = F_mu (x)$ and $F_mu (x-)$ exists.
4. For every $x in RR$, $F_mu (x) - F_mu (x -) = mu({x})$ i.e. $F_mu$ continuous at $x <=> mu({x}) = 0$.
5. For every $a < b in RR$, $F_mu (b) - F_mu (a) = mu((a, b])$, $F_mu (b-) - F_mu (a) = mu((a, b))$, $F_mu (b) - F_mu (a-) = mu([a, b])$, $F_mu (b-) - F_mu (a-) = mu([a, b))$.
6. $F_mu$ uniquely determines $mu$, i.e. if $mu, nu$ are both probability measures on $(RR, frak(B)_RR)$ and $F_mu = F_nu$ then $mu = nu$.
7. Any $F:RR -> [0, 1]$ satisfying 1., 2., and 3. is the distribution function of some probability measure $mu$ on $(RR, frak(B)_RR)$.

#definition[
  Let $mu$ a probability measure on $(RR, borel)$ with df $F_mu$. We say $mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $m$ and write $mu << m$ if $F_mu$ is absolutely continuous on $RR$. I.e., there is some $f in L^1 (RR)$ such that for every $a in RR, x>a$, $F_mu (x) - F_mu (a) = integral_a^x f(t) dif t$. Such an $f$ is called the "probability density" of $mu$.
]

#proposition[If $mu$ absolutely continuous wrt $m$ with density $f$ then for every $B in borel$, $mu(B) = integral_B f$.]

#proof[
  Let $tilde(mu)$ on $borel$ by $tilde(mu) (B) := integral_B f$ for every $B in borel$. One can verify $tilde(mu)$ a probability measure on $RR$. If $F_tilde(mu)$ the distribution function of $tilde(mu)$, then for every $x in RR$, $F_(tilde(mu)) (x) = F(x) => mu = tilde(mu)$.
]

#corollary[
  Assume $mu << m$ with density $f$. Then if $g : RR -> RR$ Borel-measurable, then $integral_RR |g| dif mu = integral_RR |g(x)|f(x) dif x$. In particular, $g in L^1 (mu)<=> g dot f in L^1 (RR)$.
]

#remark[
  Any equivalent description of $mu << m$ is that for every $A in borel$, if $m(A) = 0, mu(A) = 0$. More generall:
]

#theorem("Radon-Nikodym Theorem")[
  Let $mu, nu$ be two $sigma$-finite measures on $(RR, borel)$. If $forall A in borel$ $nu(A) = 0 => mu(A) = 0$ then $mu << nu$ and so there is some $f in L^1 (nu)$ such that for every $B in borel$, $mu (B) = integral_B f dif nu$. We call such an $f$ the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $mu$ with respect to $nu$, denoted by $f = (dif mu)/(dif nu)$.
]

#remark[
  On the other hand, if $mu$ is such that $mu (B) = integral_B f dif nu$ for some $f in L^1 (nu)$ and for every $B in borel$, then $nu$-null $=>$ $mu$-null.
]

#theorem("Lebesgue Decomposition Theorem")[
Given $mu$ any probability measure on $(RR, borel)$, $mu$ admits a _unique_ decomposition $mu = mu_a + mu_s$ such that 
1. $mu_a$ a finite measure on $(RR, borel)$ and $mu_a << m$.
2. $mu_s$ a finite measure on $(RR, borel)$ such that "$mu_s perp m$", that is $mu_s$ "singular" to $m$ i.e. there exists $E in borel$ such that $m(E) = 0$ but $mu_s (E^c) = 0$.
]

#proof[
  Set $lambda = mu + m$. Then, $lambda$ a $sigma$-finite measure on $(RR, borel)$ and for every $A in borel$, if $lambda (A) = 0$, then $mu(A) = m(A) = 0$. By R-N Thm, there is some $f, g in L^1 (lambda)$ such that $mu(B) = integral_B f dif lambda, m(B) = integral_B g dif lambda$ for every $B in borel$.

  Set $E := {x in RR : g(x) = 0}$. Then, $m(E) = 0$. Define $mu_a, mu_s$ by for every $B in borel$ by $mu_a (B) = mu (B sect E^c), mu_s (B) = mu (B sect E)$.

  Then, $mu = mu_a + mu_s$ and $mu_s (E^c) = mu (E^c sect E) = 0$.

  We need to show $mu_a << m$. Assume $A in borel$ is such that $m(A) = 0$. Then, $
  0 = integral_A g dif lambda = cancel(integral_(A sect E) g dif lambda) + integral_(A sect E^c) g dif lambda => lambda(A sect E^c) = 0,
  $ so $mu (A sect E^c) = mu_a (A) = 0$.

  Let $F : RR -> [0, 1]$ be $1$ for $x >= 1$, $0$ for $x <= 0$, and the Cantor Lebesgue function on $[0, 1]$. Then, $F$ is a distribution function of a (unique) probability measure $mu$. In fact, $mu perp m$. For instance, if $C$ is the Cantor set, $m(C) = 0$ and $mu (RR\\C) = 0$.
