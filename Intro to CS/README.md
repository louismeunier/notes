# Introduction to Computer Science

Based on the course [COMP250](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2022-2023/courses/comp-250) from McGill University. Its a fairly introductory computer science course covering data structures, sorting, etc., but does assume a solid knowledge of object-oriented programming (the course is based in Java, but should be understandable without necessarily knowing Java).
