# Calculus 2

Based on the course [MATH X12](https://extension.berkeley.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=22828946) (Calculus 2) from UC Berkeley Extension.

Fair warning: I was still very new to Latex when writing these notes, so they're a little rough, formatting-wise, and there are quite a lot of just broken equations...sorry!
