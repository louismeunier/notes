# Calculus A & B

Based on the courses [MATH150](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2022-2023/courses/math-150) and [MATH151](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2022-2023/courses/math-151) from McGill University. These two courses are the equivalent of the standard Calculus I, II, and III sequence.

This course roughly follows the content of James Stewart's *Calculus Early Transcendentals, 8th edition*.
